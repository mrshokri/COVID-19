            "text": "On 23 March 2020, the UK announced the \"stay at home\" order and entered the first national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an enforced isolation can be associated with a subjective feeling of lack of companionship or a mismatch between one's perceived and desired social relationships, which is called loneliness (Reinhardt et al., 2020) . Recent studies among UK residents have found that young adults were at the highest risk of experiencing loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown (Bu et al., 2020; Li & Wang, 2020; O'Connor et al., 2020) . These studies have focused on the early months of the pandemic, with one study finding that individuals aged between 18 and 29 reported higher levels of loneliness, but experienced a decrease in loneliness from March to May 2020. However, research has yet to examine the trajectory of loneliness for young adults during the summer to winter months of 2020. Given that loneliness levels are likely to vary due to changes in restrictions, along with a possible rise during the winter months (Victor et al., 2015) , this period is an important one to investigate.",

We focused on young adults aged 18 to 25, in line with the theory of emerging adulthood. This theory characterises this period as one of identity explorations, new independence, physical separation from family and friends, intimate relationships, school transitions, and entry into the workforce (Arnett, 2014) . Not surprisingly, this is also the period during which loneliness is often the most prevalent across the lifespan (Qualter et al., 2015) . Being lonely in young adulthood has a range of negative implications, which can persist into later life. Young adults who are lonelier tend to have more mental health problems, engage in more physical health risk behaviours, adopt more negative coping strategies, and have a lower income (Matthews et al., 2019; Von Soest et al., 2020) . In all, existing literature highlights the importance of investigating the factors associated with loneliness in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic for intervention purposes.",

In a sample of more than 35,000 adults in the UK, for instance, Bu and colleagues (2020) found that having more than three close friends was a protective factor against loneliness during the strict lockdown period (March to May 2020). Gender differences have also been shown in the stress-buffering effect of social support for young adults. In a college student sample aged 18-25, for example, Lee and Goldstein (2016) found a greater adverse impact of low levels of emotional support on loneliness in females than in males. The authors concluded that this may be due to females' greater sensitivity to lack of support when compared to males.",

In line with previous research (Bu et al., 2020; Li and Wang, 2020; O'Connor et al., 2020) , we expected that those who report more emotional support, live with romantic partners, are employed or in school, and have a larger household income report less loneliness; while those with a physical or mental health condition report more loneliness.

The use of growth curve modelling is advantageous as it does not require equal spacing between time points and accounts for missing outcome data. To assess the trajectory of loneliness, time was coded to reflect the number of months from Wave 3, where Wave 3 = 0, Wave 4 = 1, Wave 5 = 3, Wave 6 = 5. A level 1 model examined within-individual change in loneliness, assessing the linear slope (i.e., average rate of change) and quadratic slope (i.e., degree of curvature averaged across the sample). A level 2 model then incorporated significant covariates and interactions, examining the associations between gender and emotional support at the intercept, linear slope, and quadratic slope. Models were examined using maximum likelihood estimation to account for missing data. Due to the restriction in the degrees of freedom, the residual variance component of the quadratic slope was not included in the models. Table 2 presents the final growth curve model, with coefficient estimates of the intercept and slopes accounting for the self-reported loneliness trajectory from June to November 2020. As shown in Fig. 2 , on average, those aged 18 to 25 experienced a decrease in self-reported loneliness from June through July and then an increase from September to November 2020. The positive quadratic trend for time was highly significant, indicating a U-shape trajectory of self-reported loneliness over time (see Table 2 ).",

            "text": "The U-shaped self-reported loneliness trajectory from June to November 2020 might point to two main directions. First, this might imply that there is a seasonal variation in loneliness. As earlier research has addressed, loneliness peaks during the winter months among older adults (Victor et al., 2015) . While less research has focused on the 18-25 age group, young adults can also suffer from lack of companionship during the winter months. Indeed, after hitting the lowest in July, the mean loneliness level rose again towards November. However, as the current analysis only covered June to November, this seasonal variation explanation needs further examination. Second, the trajectory of self-reported loneliness might correspond to the extent to which social activities were limited due to the lockdown policies. Looking at the policy changes during this period (see Fig. 1 ), it seems plausible that the further easing of social distancing policies from June to July mapped onto the reduced loneliness from Wave 3 to Wave 4. During the two-month interval between July and September, the new 'rule of 6' was introduced. This was also when an increase in loneliness was reported in the Wave 5 data, toward the end of September. Finally, the introduction of 3-tier local alert levels system and the start of the second national lockdown seem to correspond to the further rise in selfreported loneliness in November, exceeding the initial level observed in June. This explanation is in line with previous research highlighting the importance of social connection in predicting levels of loneliness for this age group (Qualter et al., 2015) .",

For this reason, no firm conclusions can be made about the factors that predict loneliness in young adults. Second, there could be sampling biases. For example, having access to the internet was a fundamental requirement to complete the web surveys from Understanding Society. Third, some measures were limited due to the constraint on the questionnaires. For example, the survey included one-item measures of loneliness and emotional support. These selfreported measures may not have the complexity to capture a more nuanced picture of either construct. Furthermore, the survey only asked about the amount of emotional support received from individuals outside the household, disregarding support from household members as well as the quality of support received. Fourth, a quantifiable measure of emotional support was not gathered at Waves 1 and 2 and subsequent waves after Wave 3. Thus, it was not possible to investigate how emotional support predicts the trajectory of loneliness from Wave 1 and whether changes in emotional support over time predict changes in the trajectory of loneliness among UK young adults.",
