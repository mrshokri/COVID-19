    "Title": "Facebook Friend Request Nearly Cost One North Carolina Woman Thousands",
    "Content": "A North Carolina woman is trying to warn others about a Facebook scam that she nearly fell victim to. It came from a friend, and it could have cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nCheryl Albrecht is a nutrition director at Randolph County Senior Adults Association. She recently told WGHP News about the scam that started when she received a friend request on Facebook from an elderly woman she knows.\n\nThe woman claimed to have been awarded money by the federal government.\n\n\u201cShe had seen my name on the winners list as well and wanted to know if I\u2019d gotten my money,\u201d Albrecht said.\n\nThe friend told Albrecht that all she needed to do was send a friend request to a man she didn\u2019t know and follow his instructions to collect the money. When she did, Albrecht quickly realized it was a scam.\n\nThe man first asked for additional personal information, including her home address and marital status. Then he asked her to send him $2,000 in order to collect the money.\n\nIt\u2019s an old trick, but people still fall for it. The FBI refers to such scams as \u201cadvance fee schemes,\u201d according to an ABC News story from earlier this year about a Texas woman who fell victim to one. The schemes involve the victim paying out money in order to collect a larger prize that doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThey are easy to spot, but for Albrecht, her trouble didn\u2019t stop when she refused to pay.\n\n\u201cHe still hounded me,\u201d she said. \u201cLiterally, \u2018do you want your money? Do you want your money?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs the harassment continued, Albrecht learned that the original friend request came from an account created by a person posing as the woman she knows.\n\nThe contact with the scammer stopped for a few weeks, then started again. This time it was an older scam. Albrecht was told she had won a Facebook lottery.\n\nThat scam has been around for years. It occasionally takes the form of an advance fee scheme, but the Better Business Bureau believes the scam is more about installing malware on victims\u2019 computers through bad links included in the emails.\n\nLuckily for Albrecht she didn\u2019t fall for that scam either. But she wants others, particularly the seniors she works with on a daily basis, to be aware.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my concern; I didn\u2019t want any more of my former seniors or my current seniors to be finagled out of their hard-earned money,\u201d she said.\n\nSources: WGHP News, ABC News, Better Business Bureau \/ Photo Credit: Franco Bouly \/ Flickr"

    "Content": "Liberian Health Clinics Reopen Slowly with Renewed Vigilance\n\nVoA - News Thursday 1st January, 2015\n\nDAKAR\/MONROVIA - The World Health Organization says the number of new confirmed Ebola cases in Liberia is \"declining.\" Liberians were once at the epicenter of this regional epidemic but several parts of the country have now gone weeks without reporting any new cases. Some medical staff are returning to work amid renewed vigilance. It's an important sign of progress.\n\nThe Dolo Town Health Center, just outside the Liberian capital, is open.\n\nMothers bring their children for vaccinations against polio and measles.\n\nPeople come in for tuberculosis treatment and HIV counseling. A midwife said she delivered ten babies since they reopened a month ago.\n\nThe sheer normalcy of it all has the feel of the remarkable.\n\nLiberia's health system collapsed in August as Ebola bore down on Monrovia. Dolo Town was one of two suburbs put under an abrupt quarantine.\n\nThe quarantine was lifted two weeks later, but the community continued to battle Ebola. Locals say more than four dozen people are believed to have died here of the virus.\n\nEven now at year's end, a local task force watches for sporadic cases. This newly opened clinic is not taking any chances. They built a special waiting area in front. Midwife Kebeh Karmo keeps a close watch.\n\n\"In sitting under here please we shouldn't sit jammed up beside one another because you don't know who is who. Ebola patient might be among ushellip;We are protecting you and protecting ourselves,\" she said.\n\nStaff wear gloves. They screen for Ebola symptoms like fever and send those patients to a larger care center nearby.\n\nThe clinic has a stock of PPE's just in case. That's the full-body protective gear staff should wear if there see a suspected Ebola case.\n\nPhysician's assistant McFarland Kerkulah said getting those PPE's persuaded most of the nurses to return. \"That is why we are having the courage to work right now,\" said Kerkulah.\n\nAs Ebola surged in Liberia in mid-2014, many medical staff didn't even have gloves. More and more of them were getting sick. Health workers went on strike. Most clinics shut down. People were afraid to go the clinics still open.\n\nIt was tragedy multiplied. The government said people would die of treatable, preventable causes - childbirth complications, malaria, respiratory illness, high blood pressure.\n\nInternational Ebola response ramped up in Liberia in October. At year's end, the epidemic is not over, but the worst of it may be.\n\nA few big hospitals have reopened. Small community clinics like this one are edging open their doors.\n\n\"Good morning. I know everybody wash their hands before. If you didn't do that then you need to do that. [hearing water as people wash hands] If you didn't do it, we not allow you in,\" said Kerkulah.\n\nEvery morning, the Dolo Town Health Center gives out tickets. Staff triage cases giving priority to the most critical. This used to be a 24-hour clinic but now they see just 25 people per day. It's a safety measure. Non-urgent cases are told to return the next day.\n\nKerkulah is a strong believer in what he calls \"holistic care.\"\n\n\"We want to say thank you for coming and we want everybody to be relaxed. Everyone will get treatment before one o'clock,\" he said.\n\nKerkulah says they will soon start the day's consulations but first. \"We will ask one person to give us a short song so we will start.\"\n\nAnd with that, a new day begins."

Baliclic of Piddig, Ilocos Norte; Assen Shierra A. Biggayan of Brgy. Centro, Abulug, Cagayan; Mia C. Garcia of Brgy. Cristo Rey, Capaz, Tarlac; and Joan S. Kirit of Brgy. Diego Silang Village, Ususan, Taguig City.\n\n\u201cMost of the ten teachers have already submitted complete documentary requirements, while some are still in the process,\u201d Bureau of Local Employement Director Nikki Tutay told Baldoz.\n\n\u201cThey are already assured to be hired as teachers,\u201d she said .\n\nA Teacher I position, Baldoz said, pays an entry level salary of P20,549 a month including a Cost of Living Allowance of P2,000. With deductions of P4,049.81 which consist of income tax, GSIS, PagIBIG, and PhilHealth contribution, the take-home pay is P16,499.19.\n\nShe said perks and benefits included clothing\/uniform allowance of P5,000 per year; year-end bonus equivalent to one month basic pay; cash gift of P5,000; performance bonus depending on teaching performance; and productivity enhancement of P5,000.\n\n\u201cMoreover, teachers also receive incentives, such as proportional vacation pay equivalent to 70 days; Christmas vacation pay equivalent to 14 days; and a chalk allowance of P1,000 per year,\u201d Baldoz explained.\n\nOther privileges are a one-step increment for every three years of continuous satisfactory performance; hardship allowance for teachers assigned in hardship posts (i.e., cannot be reached by regular means of transportation, but only through hiking or banca\/motorcylce rides); mobile teachers and multi-grade teachers (15-25 percent of basic salary); and honoraria for teaching overload subject to funds availability.\n\n\u201cThis pay is for single teachers. The pay for married teachers with dependents is higher a bit,\u201d she said.\n\nThis project for domestic worker-teachers is very encouraging. It guarantees them careers in the public education system and weans them away from their previous domestic work occupations, Baldos said.\n\nThe DOLE has conceived \u2018Sa \u2018Pinas, Ikaw ang Ma\u2019am Project\u2019 to provide licensed teachers working abroad, either as domestic workers or non-teaching related occupations, to come home and teach instead.\n\n\u201cThe DepEd has 1,300 teaching vacancies left for 2014 and 39,000 vacant teacher positions in 2015,\u201d Baldoz said."

    "Content": "SYDNEY: Most Australian states and territories are set to ban commercial sunbeds from Thursday, in a crackdown on artificial tanning in a country that has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world.\n\nThe ban \u2014 which comes into force in the states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and in the Australian Capital Territory on January 1 \u2014 will make Australia the second nation after Brazil to impose such a restriction, campaigners said.\n\nWestern Australia has said it would also implement a ban, though it has yet to announce a start date. There are no commercial solariums in the only other part of Australia \u2014 the hot and humid Northern Territory.\n\nCancer Council Australia welcomed the ban, which it has long pushed for, adding that it would help to reduce rates of skin cancer, which affects two out of three Australians by age 70.\n\n\u201cAustralia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world,\u201d advocacy director Paul Grogan said in a statement to AFP.\n\n\u201cSolariums expose users to extremely highly levels of UV (ultraviolet) radiation, greatly increasing their risk of melanoma and other skin cancers.\u201d\n\nAustralia is sometimes referred to as the sunburnt country, where beaches are thronged with bathers basking under blue skies and the rates of melanoma, a potentially fatal form of skin cancer, are the highest in the world.\n\nPublic health campaigners have long pushed to promote awareness of the dangers of exposure to the sun, urging people to wear sunscreen, hats and sunglasses. They have also warned that tanning on a sunbed is not safe.\n\n\u201cQueensland already has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world and there is no question there\u2019s a direct link between regular sunbed use and the incidence of malignant melanoma,\u201d the state\u2019s interim Health Minister Mark McArdle told Australian Associated Press.\n\nThe incidence of skin cancers in Australia is two to three times the rates in Canada, the United States and Britain, the Cancer Council said. More than 2000 Australians died from skin cancer in 2011, the majority from melanoma, which is caused by harmful ultraviolet light from the sun, the council added.\n\nAustralia\u2019s proximity to Antarctica, where there is a hole in the ozone layer which normally filters out UV rays, also increases the risk."

    "Content": "MEDIA RELEASE\n\nThe State Public Charter School Commission has presented its annual report to the State Board of Education, the third annual report by the Commission since its creation in 2012 by Act 130.\n\nThe report, which primarily provides information from the 2013-2014 school year, highlights both successes and ongoing challenges in Hawaii\u2019s charter system.\n\nAct 130 created the Commission with a principal focus on accountability-related authorizer functions, including the development and implementation of a rigorous accountability system that safeguards student and public interests while at the same time valuing the autonomy and flexibility of Hawaii\u2019s public charter schools.\n\nAs part of the new system, all of Hawaii\u2019s 34 charter schools currently operate pursuant to a three-year charter contract under which the academic, financial, and organizational performance of each school is evaluated annually.\n\nThe report includes detailed information on every individual school\u2019s results, as well as information about how the charter sector is performing as a whole and about the challenges the schools and the system face.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s clear that much work remains to be done, overall Hawaii\u2019s charter schools and its chartering system continue to show promising signs of improvement,\u201d said Commission Executive Director Tom Hutton.\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\nAcademic\n\n* As measured by the State\u2019s Strive HI Performance System in 2013-2014, the charter schools\u2019 collective results fell under the statewide averages on most indicators of academic performance.\n\n* On the other hand, charter schools showed collective progress over 2012-2013 results on every Strive HI indicator except two.\n\n* All five charter schools that had been classified in the bottom \u201cPriority\u201d tier under Strive HI in the previous year showed progress under Strive HI in 2013-2014, with one reclassified this year into the next highest \u201cFocus\u201d category.\n\n* As measured by Strive HI, five of the state\u2019s 11 top-performing public high schools\u2014Myron B. Thompson Academy, Kula Aupuni Niihau A Kahelelani Aloha (KANAKA) A New Century Public Charter School (PCS), University Laboratory School, Hawaii Academy of Arts and Science (HAAS), and Halau Ku Mana Public Charter School\u2014and two of its four top-performing public middle schools\u2014Voyager: A Public Charter School and Innovations Public Charter School\u2014were charter schools.\n\n* This was the first year the Commission implemented its own Academic Performance Framework (APF), which evaluates charter schools differently than does Strive HI, including by placing heavier emphasis on proficiency and growth among high-needs students and by proportionally weighing the results for each grade level (elementary, middle, and high) for schools that serve more than one grade level.\n\n* While it must be emphasized that these are only first-year results, under the APF, 21 schools either did not meet or fell far below the overall standard, 10 schools met the standard, and two schools\u2014KANAKA and Ka \u2018Umeke K\u0101\u2018eo\u2014exceeded the standard.\n\nFinancial\n\n* Financial data continue to show that charter schools generally are good stewards of public funding, a very important point in light of revelations of financial mismanagement at one school.\n\n* While some financial indicators for charter schools collectively improved last year, the data signal longer-term sustainability challenges for charter schools if funding levels remain essentially flat and\/or schools are not able to realize more cost savings.\n\nOrganizational\n\n* This year the schools\u2019 organizational capacities were measured primarily by whether they had some fairly basic policies and practices in place in five areas, a deliberately incremental approach that acknowledges that the schools were not asked for these things consistently under the previous law and that most are lightly staffed.\n\n* Most schools fulfilled all or almost all of the 2013-2014 organizational measures.\n\n* The organizational framework highlights the need for additional attention to certain issues, including the transparency of school governing boards and the securing of needed permits and certificates for charter school facilities on state lands.\n\n\u201cThis report helps all of us take stock of where we are in implementing the vision of Act 130,\u201d said Commission Chairperson Catherine Payne. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult, and we still have a long way to go, but the Commission remains committed to the hard work of ensuring that our charter schools are able to fulfill their missions and their responsibilities to the public and our keiki.\u201d\n\nThe Commission also will deliver its annual report to the State Legislature.\n\nThe report is available at the Commission\u2019s website, www.chartercommission.hawaii.g\u2026, by clicking on \u201cInformation & Resources\u201d and then \u201cReports,\u201d or at the following link: media.wix.com\/ugd\/448fc8_005c5\u2026"

    "Content": "Gasoline prices are on the verge of crashing down to below $2 a gallon. The price of oil may dip below $50 a barrel.\n\nEven with renewed demand from a global economic resurgence, energy prices continue to fall. The U.S. has suddenly become the world's largest combined producer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThat fact -- along with a desire to weaken hostile Iran and Russia -- has prompted the oil-rich Gulf sheikdoms to keep pumping oil even as the price falls. In their game of petro-chicken, the desperate sheiks hope that either their poorer enemies will run out of cash, or that fracking in the U.S. will become unprofitable and cease.\n\nEveryone seems to have forgotten about \"peak oil\" -- the catchphrase of the new millennium.\n\nThe world in general, and the United States in particular, supposedly had already burned more oil than was left under the Earth. Under President Barack Obama, gasoline prices had soared. When he entered office in January 2009, gas prices averaged around $1.60 per gallon. Four years later, by spring of 2013, gas prices had climbed beyond $3.50 a gallon.\n\nThe Obama administration never much worried about high energy costs. During the 2008 campaign, Obama promised that, \"Under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\" Shutting down coal plants and using higher-priced but cleaner natural gas would pave the way for an even pricier mandated wind and solar generation.\n\nIn the vice presidential debates of 2008, Joe Biden mocked Sarah Palin for the supposedly mindless campaign mantra of \"Drill, baby, drill.\" Biden intoned that, \"It will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.\"\n\nThe energy secretary-designate, the professorial Steven Chu, in 2008 had unwisely voiced a widely held but wisely unspoken progressive belief that, \"Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe\" -- or about $9 a gallon.\n\nJust two years ago, when up for re-election, Obama reminded Americans, \"We can't just drill our way to lower gas prices.\"\n\nObama ridiculed the Republican idea of lowering gas to $2 a gallon through new oil-recovery techniques. \"They're already dusting off their three-point plans for $2 gas,\" Obama mocked. \"I'll save you the suspense: Step one is drill, step two is drill, and step three is keep drilling.\"\n\nSuch easy rhetoric was backed by action -- or lack of it. The Keystone XL pipeline was put on permanent hold. New fracking leases on federal lands were postponed. Huge areas of oil- and gas-rich federal lands were put off-limits. Some blue states stopped fracking. Money poured into solar schemes like Solyndra."

Asio had undergone a decade of change, started by the the first royal commission in 1974, established by the Whitlam government under Justice Robert Hope. That process led to changes brought in by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act of 1979. A year after its election in 1983, Labor established a second inquiry \u2013 the royal commission into Australia\u2019s security and intelligence agencies, also under Hope \u2013 which provoked another shakeup in national security and intelligence services.\n\nAs a result, the attorney general was given more powers over Asio and Asio was given powers to collect foreign intelligence in Australia.\n\nPreviously, warrants could not be issued for the collection of intelligence relating to foreign groups or powers from Australian citizens and permanent residents. In a submission on 2 June 1988, the attorney general, Lionel Bowen, argued this provision limited Asio\u2019s powers, while noting it was a \u201csensitive subject\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis provision does not rule out the situation, however, where an Australian is the only practicable vehicle by which foreign intelligence information can be collected about a \u2018foreign\u2019 target,\u201d Bowen said in the submission.\n\nHe said there could be some cases in which information about Australians was collected \u201cincidentally or by their deliberate involvement with a target, eg an Australian citizen aiding or abetting a foreign-sponsored terrorist effort\u201d.\n\nBut in those cases the attorney general could impose restrictions to minimise the collection or retention of such information.\n\nBowen argued that the Asio act required tabling of any guidelines to the director general of security, unless it would \u201cprejudice security\u201d. In this case, Bowen said, it would draw further attention to the new Asio powers.\n\n\u201cFurther, publication of the guidelines would prejudice the conduct of Australia\u2019s international affairs, because it would focus the attention of overseas countries, and foreign representation in Australia, on this aspect of Asio functions,\u201d Bowen wrote.\n\nBut the prime minister\u2019s department pushed back, suggesting there had not been appropriate time to consider the changes, in a familiar echo of today\u2019s security debates. And, like today, Bowen argued the decision should be made at \u201can early time\u201d.\n\nThe department noted the proposal was out of step with Hope\u2019s royal commission finding that \u201ccommunications by or with Australian citizens should not be collected and, if accidentally collected, should be destroyed\u201d.\n\nIt also noted the proposal was at odds with the then rules on foreign intelligence gathering which \u201cprohibit DSD [the Defence Signals Directorate] deliberately intercepting a \u2018foreign communication originated by, or directed to, an Australian person\u2019 \u2013 whether the person is in Australia or overseas \u2013 for the purpose of collecting foreign intelligence (unless related to security or serious crime)\u201d.\n\nThe department argued the proposed guidelines should be subject to further consideration but the security committee of cabinet approved Bowen\u2019s requests for guidelines which allowed warrants to be issued for putting Australians under surveillance to gather foreign intelligence \u201cwhere it cannot be reasonably collected by other means\u201d."

    "Title": "Happenings large and small gave us many reasons to remember 2014 as a remarkable year",
    "Content": "Related Articles Reports show the long-overdue recovery is gaining momentum, even in WNY ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll years are a mix of good and bad, and the proportions can change with location. Even still, some years stand out, and this was one of them: In Western New York, it has been a remarkable year. In the good way, or, as it\u2019s known in these parts, the Pegula way. The purchase of the Buffalo Bills by Terry and Kim Pegula wasn\u2019t the most consequential story of the year, though it\u2019s a part of that story. Nevertheless, and without question, the deal that put the Bills in the hands of the Pegulas was the most emotionally satisfying development in Western New York in 2014. With it, a worrisome and long-standing question was satisfactorily answered: What will happen to the team, adopted by the community and fully fused into its identity, when owner Ralph Wilson died? The answer: It will stay in Western New York. The Buffalo Bills will remain the Buffalo Bills \u2013 and in that announcement, the team became an integral part of the story of this city\u2019s economic and spiritual renewal.\n\nBuffalo\u2019s startling rebound That larger story is the towering event of 2014, though event is the wrong word. The year produced a percussive series of developments that sent the message: Buffalo is coming back, and the purchase of the Bills was only one part of that story. In the private sector, other developments included the rapid construction and opening of HarborCenter, a project of the Pegulas whose initial phase was completed late this year. A hotel remains under construction. The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus continued its high-tech expansion, and not far away the Catholic Health System opened its new headquarters. Local development companies announced so many plans to convert old buildings to new uses that they almost didn\u2019t qualify as news. But it was with a dramatic push from the public sector that this year really took off. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s Buffalo Billion took on the shape of economic reality, as heavy equipment moved on to the site of the RiverBend project, preparing to construct what will be the largest solar panel factory in the Western Hemisphere. Here. In Buffalo. Downtown, Canalside\u2019s development took a massive step forward with the opening of the state\u2019s largest outdoor skating rink, constructed on a site once occupied by the Erie Canal and, later, War Memorial Auditorium. The Inner Harbor welcomed a new resident, a young girl with a shark\u2019s head, while at the Outer Harbor, plans for a new park began taking shape. Here. In Buffalo.\n\nWrenching events in education There was much more to the year that Buffalo blossomed, too, and not all of it on the economic front. The Buffalo School District had a wrenching year, though one that could eventually produce important changes in the district\u2019s performance. Voters elected a reform-minded School Board and with that, the district\u2019s mismatched superintendent, Pamela C. Brown, took her leave. While members of the board\u2019s majority and minority factions continue to squabble, often mindlessly, relations with the State Education Department are demonstrably improved. The district and teachers union seem \u2013 maybe \u2013 to be taking a more serious approach to crafting a new contract, 10 years after the last one expired. And in what may have been a relief for the city district, Hamburg showed that educational dysfunction isn\u2019t reserved for Buffalo. The district was enveloped in a drama over the expulsion of a board member, while then-Superintendent Richard Jetter lied to police, telling them vandals had damaged his car when, in fact, he had sideswiped a utility pole in South Buffalo. He\u2019s out. There were other changes, too. Sen. George Maziarz, R-Newfane, announced he would not run for re-election \u2013 shortly after his aides were questioned as part of a federal investigation into operations of his office. Maziarz says the issues aren\u2019t related, and the feds aren\u2019t talking. North Tonawanda Mayor Robert G. Ortt was elected to succeed Maziarz."

Justin Mitchell reports.\n\nJerry Walter of Forest Falls, Calif., puts chains on his vehicle before heading to his home in the Southern California mountain community on Dec. 30, 2014. (Photo: AP Photo\/The Sun, Rick Sforza)\n\nFirefighters in Southern California completed the rescue early Wednesday of more than 180 motorists who were stranded when a winter storm brought snow to the San Bernardino Mountains.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Fire Department said in a news release that 136 people were rescued on State Highway 138 near the communities of Crestline and Mount Baldy, about 50 miles from Los Angeles.\n\nThe drivers became stuck after more than a foot of snow fell in the area, which was also swept by high winds. The rescues came as an arctic air mass mangled transportation routes and left thousands without power in the state.\n\nFirefighters used SnowCats to navigate the steep, snowy switchbacks of Highway 138 to rescue about 50 motorists and transport them to First Baptist Church in Crestline. Red Cross workers there provided aid.\n\nPhotos: Closer look at California weather conditions\n\nSome motorists were able to drive away as plows cleared snow away. Others abandoned their cars and walked to their homes or nearby shelters.\n\nNo serious collisions or injuries were reported.\n\nAnother 50 people were stranded in snowy conditions around Mount Baldy, with about 25 near the Mount Baldy ski area and about 25 further down the mountain near Mount Baldy Village, the department said. Eventually, about 40 people were sheltered at Mount Baldy Lodge. Others were shuttled down the hill to Fire Station 12 in San Antonio Heights.\n\nMany stranded drivers feared they would have difficulty traversing the 10% grade and sharp turns on the descent from the Baldy ski lifts, which are located at an altitude of about 6,000 feet, KNBC-TV reports.\n\n\n\nRescue operations were completed by about 3 a.m. local time, the department said.\n\nIn the Sacramento area in Northern California, more than 8,000 customers were without power Tuesday afternoon because of gusty winds.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, high winds felled trees and blocked freeways.

Nationally, the Red Cross responds to a disaster every eight minutes, and the majority are house fires.\n\n\"While tornadoes, floods and hurricanes tend to dominate the headlines, people often underestimate the frequency and devastation caused by home fires, and that\u2019s where the Red Cross comes in,\" said Heidi Ruster, Utah Red Cross region CEO. \"Our work doesn\u2019t end after the smoke clears.

    "Title": "Really, govt tech profit cash grab is a PRIZE-WINNING idea? \u2022 The Register",
    "Content": "Worstall on Wednesday So, that favourite of mine and of Andrew Orlowski, Mariana Mazzucato, has been awarded a prize by the New Statesman in the field of political economy.\n\nGiven that her message is that government should be getting more of the pie, that's the sort of political economy you would expect the magazine to like. However, I find there's a gaping hole or two in her arguments. I'll concentrate on just one here: her insistence that all those tech billionaires becoming plutocrats is one reason why we need the State to be taking more of what is rightfully its own as a result of the basic research that those tech billionaires are implementing.\n\nIt's an argument that can sometimes be made. Those who lobby to create legislatively crafted and protected monopolies should, to my mind, have that wealth taken off them. That's preparatory to making sure that the State never makes such monopolies again, of course. I'm perfectly happy that when Ferdinand Marcos, the father of me old schoolmate Bongbong, was president\/prime minister and carved up the Philippine economy that when he lost power he and his cronies then all lost some of their money.\n\nBut that's not quite what is being said here about those tech companies. What is being said is the following:\n\nIf policymakers want to get serious about tackling inequality, they need to rethink not only areas such as the wealth tax that Thomas Piketty is calling for but the received wisdom on how to generate value and wealth creation in the first place. When we have a narrow theory of who creates value and wealth, we allow a greater share of that value to be captured by a small group of actors who call themselves wealth creators. This is our current predicament and the reason why progressive parties on both sides of the Atlantic are struggling to provide a clear story of what has gone wrong in recent decades and what to do about it.\n\nWell, yes, possibly, but for that to be true then those innovators she's using as her examples of \u201cwealth creators\u201d would have to be coining it off what they're doing.\n\nSo why have we accepted such a biased story of the state\u2019s role when, as the story of Apple shows, it has done so much more than \u201cfix\u201d market failures?\n\nAs she's using Apple as an example, then so shall we. And much of her book is directed at her investigation of how all of the technologies that came together in the iPhone had originally been government-funded.\n\nNow there's no doubt that Steve Jobs (and others) did coin it out of Apple. Jobs at death was supposedly worth many billions, not all of which came from Pixar (and he made a lot less than he could have done at Apple as he got caught up in that options repricing scandal. That cost him billions alone in Apple stock*). So, he got billions, yes. But is that a greater share of value? A great share even? Or is it more like a pittance?\n\nFortunately we've a wonderful paper to tell us the truth here. I've mentioned it before: \"Schumpeterian profits in the US economy\".\n\nThe present study examines the importance of Schumpeterian profits in the United States economy. Schumpeterian profits are defined as those profits that arise when firms are able to appropriate the returns from innovative activity. We first show the underlying equations for Schumpeterian profits. We then estimate the value of these profits for the non-farm business economy. We conclude that only a minuscule fraction of the social returns from technological advances over the 1948-2001 period was captured by producers, indicating that most of the benefits of technological change are passed on to consumers rather than captured by producers.\n\nSo WHO is making bank?\n\nThese are Schumpeterian profits - that is, the profits from innovation. And the question is: what fraction of the total value created ends up sticking to the hands of the entrepreneurs? No, not the financiers, the stock markets (ie, your and my pension funds) but to the Steve Jobses of this world?\n\nThe answer is truly astonishing. It's under three per cent. Of course that's an average, but it's still an astonishing number. And given the size of that number it's really very difficult to say that Jobs's mountain of cash was \u201clarge\u201d.\n\nFinance gets a few more per cent of that value created but the vast majority of it flows through to us, the consumers. We might say it's just the satiation of lust that comes from having a new Jesus mobe. More formally, consumer surplus means that value we ascribe to whatever over the price we've had to pay for whatever. But we've also something much more with these new technologies: what we go on to do with them.\n\nFor example, with smartphones (and agreed, this is projection, it's all too new to really know yet, but we think the effect will be like that of mobiles a decade and more ago), we're pretty sure that there's going to be a boost to growth in the poorer countries simply because of the existence of smartphones. If it's the same boost we saw with the introuction of basic mobiles (opinion differs, all say it will have some, but more or less than mobiles, well, snarl at each other over that), then for every 10 per cent of the population in a country without a decent computer\/internet network, we should expect growth of 0.5 per cent in GDP per annum.\n\nThat's simply a vast number. Say the developing world is 10 per cent of the global economy: we're talking about a $35bn addition to human income for every 10 per cent of the population that gets equipped - each year, for every 10 per cent. That Steve Jobs ended up with however many billions it simply a capital sum - a once-off - that simply pales into insignificance beside that.\n\nOr, as we might put it, Professor Mazzucato doesn't seem to understand the economics of who gets the money from innovation - which isn't all that useful an attribute in someone who wants to tell us all about the economics of innovation, is it now?\n\nBy the way, no one over on this free market side of the argument is trying to insist that Steve-o deserved all that money, not at all. We're only making the observation that if we allow someone who has increased global growth rates so markedly to keep his pile of cash, then this will encourage the next person with an idea that might boost global growth rates to get on with it. This is not a moral nor justice \"deserved rewards\" style argument. It's a purely utilitarian one regarding incentives that induce people to try.\n\nAnd yes, economics is is all about incentives and perhaps we might expect a professor of the subject to grok that. \u00ae\n\nBootnote\n\n* For those who don't know it, a company can issue options to anyone it likes at any price it likes. However, if those options are in the money at issue (ie, at a lower price than the market stock price) then the amount they are in the money must be an expense against the profit and loss statement of the company (and also taxed as income to the option recipients). But number of companies decided to issue stock options on, for example, 15 Jan, but price them at whatever had been the lowest price of the last 30 days. Apple got caught up in this, issuing in the money options which didn't go through the P&L and didn't pay income tax, Jobs then declined that award of options and that lost him - or rather, failed to earn him - a number of billions.\n\nSponsored: Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management"

    "Content": "Source: Reuters - Wed, 31 Dec 2014 20:22 GMT\n\nAuthor: Reuters\n\n(Adds quotes, background throughout)\n\nBy Scott Haggett\n\nCALGARY, Alberta, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The suspected killer of eight people in Edmonton, Canada, had a criminal record dating back to 1987 and used a stolen handgun in the murders before killing himself in domestic violence that was \"planned, deliberate and targeted,\" police said.\n\nPolice found one victim's body on Monday and the remaining seven at a house elsewhere early on Tuesday. The killer committed suicide in a Vietnamese restaurant 19 miles (30 km) northeast of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta.\n\nAuthorities disclosed the name of the first victim, Cyndi Duong, 37, but said no other identities would be made public until autopsies were carried out on New Year's Day. The dead included two children.\n\nInvestigators have identified the suspected killer as 53-year-old Phu Lam, the Edmonton Journal reported, quoting unidentified sources. It said he was the co-owner of the house where the seven victims died.\n\nLocal media quoted neighbors as saying the gunman worked as a maintenance man at the restaurant where he died and had a history of being confrontational. Police said the weapon, a 9-mm pistol, was legally registered in British Columbia in 1987 and stolen in 2006.\n\nPolice said on Wednesday the eight murders and one suicide made the mass killing the deadliest in the history of the city incorporated in 1904. Edmonton, population 878,000, recorded 27 homicides in 2013 and 27 in 2014 prior to the killings.\n\nPolice Chief Rod Knecht characterized the murders as premeditated domestic violence - he used the words \"planned, deliberate and targeted\" to describe the attack - and said there was no apparent link to drugs or gang activity.\n\n\"This is a horrific event for the city and in my 39 years of policing I've never seen anything like it,\" he told a news conference late on Tuesday.\n\nThanh Le, senior pastor at the Edmonton Vietnamese Alliance Church attended by Duong, her three children and parents, said her death had devastated the congregation. \"It has shocked us,\" he said. \"There have been a lot of tears.\"\n\nThere are about 220,000 Vietnamese Canadians, according to the federal government, many of whom arrived as refugees in 1979 and 1980. Edmonton's Vietnamese community is one of the five largest in Canada. (Additional reporting by Nicole Mordant in Vancouver; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and Howard Goller)"

    "Content": "Inicio > Pol\u00edtica | Publicado el Miercoles, 31 de Diciembre del 2014 | Publicado el Miercoles, 31 de Diciembre del 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOBALES: UPDATE 1-TRLPC-EMEA lending of $1.2 trn highest since financial crisis\n\nEsta noticia ha sido le\u00edda 78 veces\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters \/ * Loan volumes 25 pct up on 2013 total\n\n\n\n* M&A financing doubles to $211.2 bln y-o-y\n\n\n\n* Refinancing still dominates lending activity (Adds details)\n\n\n\nBy Alasdair Reilly and Claire Ruckin\n\n\n\nLONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reached $1.2 trillion in 2014, the highest annual total since 2007 and 25 percent up from $930 billion in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.\n\n\n\nLending activity was buoyed by the return of acquisition financing and record refinancing.\n\n\n\nM&A loan volume of $211.2 billion was more than double the $100.2 billion raised in 2013, as confidence grew among borrowers to make debt financed acquisitions, while strong bond and equity markets gave lenders the comfort of quick repayments through the capital markets.\n\n\n\n\"The emergence of M&A was healthy and had been a long time coming. There was fresh blood brought to the market with new deals,\" a loan syndicate head said.\n\n\n\nA 12.5 billion euro ($15.17 billion) loan backing German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen's acquisition of US rival TRW Automotive was the largest loan of the year. The underwritten financing closed oversubscribed in October, underlining the market appetite for drawn term debt.\n\n\n\nIn line with other large M&A transactions, the loan included a sizeable $9.3 billion-equivalent bridge loan.\n\n\n\nGerman drugs and chemicals firms Merck KGaA and Bayer also tapped the market in 2014 for jumbo acquisition loans.\n\n\n\nMerck backed its acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich in the US with an underwritten $15.6 billion financing that included an $11.6 billion bridge loan and closed in October.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Bayer agreed a $14.2 billion loan in June, backing its acquisition of US-based Merck & Co's consumer care business. The financing comprised a $12.2 billion bridge loan and a $2 billion medium-term facility.\n\n\n\nIn September, British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco closed $13.1 billion of loans for its acquisition of brands and assets from Reynolds American and for refinancing. The deal included a $4.1 billion bridge loan.\n\n\n\nRECORD REFINANCING\n\n\n\nThe main driver of activity in 2014 remained refinancing, which made up 68 percent of total loan volume.\n\n\n\nRefinancing reached $798.3 billion in 2014, the highest on record as many of Europe's largest borrowers returned to the market to refinance or amend and extend existing facilities. High levels of market liquidity and competition between banks saw many borrowers return early to refinance existing deals well ahead of their scheduled maturities on better terms.\n\n\n\nWith banks aggressively bidding to win mandates, loan pricing remained under pressure. Average margins for single-A rated companies fell to 20bp by the end of the year, while average triple-B margins remained at 50bp.\n\n\n\n\"The refinancings we've seen this year are all tightly priced, pure relationship plays with very high hit rates,\" a senior banker said.\n\n\n\nDiversified natural resource company Glencore tapped the market in June for a $15.3 billion refinancing as it continued its trajectory away from a pure trade and commodity player, achieving cheaper pricing than on the $17.3 billion facility it arranged in 2013.\n\n\n\nNestle also returned to the market in 2014, closing an increased 6 billion euro refinancing of its one-year facility from 2013 and extending its 5 billion euro, five-year facility by another year.\n\n\n\nOther sizeable refinancings were seen for Vitol, Shell , Volkswagen and GDF Suez.\n\n\n\nWith the main wave of refinancing over, banks will now be focussed on increased levels of M&A and other non-core market segments like trade finance and infrastructure financing.\n\n\n\nLoan volume in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA) fell 23.5 percent to $145.5 billion in 2014 from $190.4 billion in 2013, driven by the collapse of the Russia loan market as a result of Western sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in Ukraine's crisis and plunging oil prices.\n\n\n\nLending to Russian borrowers -- traditionally the largest market in the CEEMEA loan market -- hit a ten-year low of $12.3 billion in 2014, 74 percent down from $47.2 billion raised in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEVERAGED M&A PICKUP\n\n\n\nM&A also fuelled an increase in activity in Europe's leveraged loan market, which rose 4.9 percent to $200.8 billion in 2014 year-on-year, the highest volume since the financial crisis.\n\n\n\nSome $61 billion were acquisition-related, making up 30.3 percent of leveraged loan volume, up from 23 percent in 2013 and 17.9 percent in 2012, according to the data. Of all leveraged M&A volume, just under half (44.2 percent) was for corporate leveraged borrowers rather than sponsors, compared to 34.6 percent in 2013.\n\n\n\nAfter ZF Friedrichshafen, the second largest European leveraged loan of 2014 was a 6.8 billion euro loan for DE Master Blenders, which refinanced debt and helped fund a merger of its coffee business with that of Mondelez into a combined company called Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The euro loan formed part of a wider 7.6 billion euro-equivalent financing.\n\n\n\nA 2.85 billion euro loan, which included 1.9 billion euros of term loans, backing French telecoms operator Numericable's acquisition of rival firm SFR, was Europe's largest-ever covenant-lite leveraged loan. The loan formed part of a wider 4.7 billion euro-equivalent dual-denominated leveraged loan for the company, which in turn formed part of a wider $21.9 billion loan and bond financing.\n\n\n\n\"M&A has come back. 2015 will be another record year again as more M&A activity is expected next year,\" a lawyer said.\n\n\n\nBNP Paribas once again topped the EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table, with a $55 billion share of the market from 249 deals. Deutsche Bank was a close second, with $54.6 billion and 151 deals, while Citigroup was third, with $40.2 billion and 113 deals.

    "Content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China has promoted the ethnic Uighur governor of the troubled far western region of Xinjiang to the country's top energy policy body, Chinese media reported on Wednesday, but left unclear who would replace him.\n\nNur Bekri will become director of the National Energy Administration, and also a deputy head of the planning body the National Development and Reform Commission, respected business magazine Caixin said on its website.\n\nNur Bekri will be one of the few ethnic minorities to assume a senior position in central government, underscoring his loyalty to the party where top posts are almost all held by majority Han Chinese.\n\nThe official Xinjiang Daily said Nur Bekri's position as Xinjiang's deputy Communist Party boss would be taken by Shohrat Zakir, a former mayor of regional capital Urumqi.\n\nIt did not say if he would also assume the position of governor, but as deputy party chief, he would be an obvious candidate.\n\nXinjiang, home of the Muslim Uighur people, has been racked by violence blamed by the government on Islamist extremists who want to set up an independent state called East Turkestan. Hundreds have died in the last two years or so.\n\nThe Xinjiang Daily quoted the region's party chief Zhang Chunxian as praising Nur Bekri as an \"outstanding ethnic minority cadre\" with all the qualifications for leadership and someone who has made \"important contributions\" to Xinjiang's stability.\n\n\"On big issues of right and wrong he is clear-headed and makes public his stance,\" Zhang said.\n\nXinjiang, energy-rich and strategically located on the borders of central Asia, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, is crucial to China's growing energy needs as well as its security.\n\nNur Bekri's appointment highlights the importance of Xinjiang as an energy hub, well-endowed with oil, gas, coal and minerals. But it remains too early to judge whether it signals the start of a drive to open up the tightly state-controlled energy sector.\n\n\"Xinjiang is potentially a major energy province, and as the chairman of the region he certainly is the most experienced in its energy business,\" said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Centre for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Ryan Woo)"

    "Title": "Congressman: Government Should Track Police Deadly Force Cases",
    "Content": "Over the past few months, police use of excessive force has been a hot topic across the country with deaths of unarmed black men from Ferguson, Missouri to a Walmart in Ohio to New York City.\n\nThese incidents have brought into question whether or not deadly force was necessary and if race played a role in the deaths. But one the one thing that has surprised many people is there is no official database documenting police use of excessive force.\n\nDemocratic Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee has proposed a bill that would require law enforcement to collect data on deadly force incidents and report it to the Justice Department to be recorded in a national public database.\n\n\u201cWhen you take all the cases in the country together \u2014 which is over a hundred a year \u2014 you can draw some conclusions,\u201d Cohen told Here & Now\u2019s Robin Young about the need for the database.\n\nThe data would record both the demographics of the officer and the victim to determine whether there is a racial disparity in deadly force incidents.\n\nIn addition, Cohen says Congress is working on a bill to address other issues in the criminal justice process used to bring charges against officers, including the need for an independent prosecutor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an inherent conflict of interest for the [district attorney] \u2014 who generally prosecutes this type of crime \u2014 and always has law enforcement officers as witnesses, and the D.A.s are lax to prosecute a law enforcement person,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nCohen says he recognizes the dangers of police work, but he also recognizes that many African-Americans \u2014 including those in his district \u2014 don\u2019t feel comfortable interacting with police.\n\n\u201cI am pro good police. And if there is a bad policeman who uses unnecessary force, they need to be disciplined,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cMost cops are great people \u2014 community policing needs to be more used so that officers come in contact with people in the neighborhood and are seen as good guys. And they are good guys, but they need to be seen that way.\u201d\n\nGuest\n\nSteve Cohen, Democratic representative for Tennessee\u2019s ninth Congressional district. He tweets @RepCohen.\n\nRelated"

    "Content": "South Korea's two top technology firms, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, have a history of bitter rivalry, but their latest spat over a handful of washing machines has prompted a barrage of public mockery.\n\n[SEOUL] South Korea's two top technology firms, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, have a history of bitter rivalry, but their latest spat over a handful of washing machines has prompted a barrage of public mockery.\n\n\"This is all so petty and juvenile,\" a reader on online portal Naver said of the dispute, which began in September when Samsung accused LG executives of damaging its washing machines at stores in Germany ahead of an industry event.\n\nLG agreed to pay for what it called accidental damage to four machines following mediation by German authorities, but couldn't resist taking a pot shot at its rival's build quality.\n\nSamsung railed against those \"slanderous claims\" and filed a formal complaint at home, triggering a raid of LG offices by Seoul prosecutors on Friday and a travel ban on LG's head of household appliances.\n\n\"This is a mudslinging match,\" said Park Ju-gun, head of corporate watchdog CEO Score. \"Both Samsung and LG will have a hard time getting the public to understand why things have gone on this way, and there is not a single thing for either party to gain from this.\"\n\nThat bemusement, punctuated by a collective snicker, found a voice online. \"If all that has been said is true, then this is nothing but a petty dispute you'd expect from street corner shops and not global companies,\" said a reader on the Nate portal.\n\nOn the streets, too, the comments were scathing.\n\n\"This incident shows the problem with the corporate culture in South Korean conglomerates,\" said Lee Hyeon-woo, an office worker in Seoul. \"The mentality of these companies is not 'We're number one' but 'We must take down rival X'.\"\n\nThe cross-town rivals compete on several fronts, especially televisions and home appliances, and have a history of feuding.\n\nThey have quarrelled publicly over whose refrigerator could hold more, and who had a bigger share of the domestic air conditioning market, and current and former workers say they routinely spy on each other at trade shows.\n\nSamsung declined further comment. LG said it has been cooperating with prosecutors, who would not disclose details of the investigation.\n\nNeither company appears ready to let the matter drop. LG has filed its own complaint with prosecutors accusing Samsung employees of deliberately concealing and tampering with evidence.\n\nTheir energy would be better spent responding to the challenge from Chinese competitors, said another exasperated commenter on Naver. \"What are you people doing?\" the person asked.\n\nREUTERS"

He complained about people using the incident to attack his daughter-in-law.\n\nTerry Rutledge told The Washington Post that Veronica Rutledge and her husband practiced at shooting ranges and each had a concealed weapons permit. He said for Christmas this year, her husband gave her the purse with a special zippered pocket for a concealed weapon.\n\nAbout 7 percent of adults in Idaho had concealed weapons permits at the end of 2012, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. That ranked Idaho among the top third of states.\n\nKootenai County, which has about 140,000 residents, has issued close to 16,000 concealed weapons permits, Kootenai County sheriff's spokesman Stu Miller said Wednesday.\n\n\"It's very commonplace in northern Idaho for folks to have a concealed weapons permit,\" Miller said, and most businesses do not prohibit firearms.\n\nVeronica Rutledge lived in Blackfoot, in southeastern Idaho, and her family had come to the Hayden area to visit relatives for Christmas.\n\nShe was an employee of the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, where she was a nuclear scientist. The laboratory supports the U.S. Department of Energy in nuclear and energy research and national defense.\n\n\"We're deeply saddened by this tragedy,\" said Nicole Stricker, a spokeswoman for the lab.\n\nRutledge graduated from high school in Harrison, a lakeside town in the Idaho Panhandle. She was the valedictorian of her class. She graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in chemistry.\n\nShe had taken the children to Wal-Mart on Tuesday morning to spend their Christmas gift cards, family members said. Her young son, her only child, was in a shopping cart.\n\nResponding deputies found Rutledge dead in the electronics section of the Wal-Mart in Hayden, a rural town of about 12,000 people 40 miles northeast of Spokane.\n\nColt Rutledge, 32, arrived at the store in Idaho's northern panhandle shortly after the shooting around 10:20 a.m. Tuesday, Miller said. All the children were taken to a relative's house.\n\nOfficers viewed surveillance video provided by the store to determine what happened, Miller said."

He was released on bail three days later.\n\nJohnson faces one count of distribution of a controlled substance in Washington County.\n\nThornton, also of Chatom, is wanted on four counts of distribution of a controlled substance. Authorities booked him into the Baldwin County Corrections Center on one count of possession of a controlled substance on April 18. He was released from jail May 2.\n\nLucious may be in the Citronelle or Mobile area, Washington County deputies said.

    "Content": "Satellite equipment that captures high-resolution photos of weather systems has spotted a wind shear credited with breaking apart a tropical depression after it crossed the southern and central Philippines.\n\nTropical depression Jangmi encountered the moderate to strong southeasterly vertical wind shear in the Sulu Sea, and NASA-NOAA's Suomi NPP satellite captured photos of the phenomenon on Wednesday.\n\nWhen it was a stronger tropical storm, Jangmi generated flooding blamed for the deaths of 31 people in the Philippines on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm was pounding the coastal areas of Sabah, Malaysia's easternmost state, on Wednesday as it churned in the Sulu Sea between Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nBut because of the shear, NASA believes the storm's centre never made it to Palawan, a large Philippine island to the north of Malaysia bordering the Sulu Sea.\n\nThe NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) satellite passed over Jangmi early Wednesday morning and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument image revealed the effects of wind shear, NASA said.\n\n\"The VIIRS image showed that the north, northeastern and eastern quadrants of the storm were almost devoid of clouds and showers, as they were being pushed to the northwest and west of the centre. Those thunderstorms northwest of the centre were weakening. Some of the thunderstorms were being pushed to the northwest and over the island of Palawan,\" NASA said.\n\nWind shear occurs when there is a change of wind speed or direction along either vertical or horizontal distances. Vertical shear typically occurs near the surface and can influence the strength of a storm.\n\n\"JTWC [Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center] noted that upper-level analysis indicates the system has moved into a hostile environment with moderate to high southeasterly vertical wind shear,\" the space agency said.\n\nThe warning centre's forecasters expect Jangmi to dissipate within a day.\n\nThe NPP satellite was launched in October 2011 to gather data for both short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate monitoring."

    "Title": "Fairmont: Ont SCJ unwinds share redemption and substitutes loan arrangement",
    "Content": "Canada December 30 2014\n\nThe common law doctrine of rectification operates to correct mistakes in transactions that produce (or may produce) unintended and adverse tax results. This was established in the landmark case of Juliar et. al. v A.G. (Canada) (50 O.R. 3d 728) (Ont. C.A.) (Dentons was counsel to the successful taxpayers).\n\nIn Fairmont Hotels Inc. et al. v A.G. (Canada) (2014 ONSC 7302) the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has provided another example of the manner in which rectification can be used to unwind certain impugned steps in a transaction and substitute the proper steps that accord with the parties\u2019 intention to avoid tax.\n\nLegacy Hotels REIT owned a collection of hotels, which were purchased from Fairmont in or around 1997. Fairmont continued to manage these hotels. In 2002 and 2003, Fairmont was involved in the financing of Legacy\u2019s purchase of two hotels in Washington and Seattle. Through the use of several reciprocal loans between Legacy, Fairmont and several subsidiary companies, Legacy purchased the Washington hotel for $67 million USD and the Seattle hotel for $19 million USD. Fairmont hedged its loans to eliminate or reduce its foreign exchange tax exposure in Canada.\n\nIn 2006, Fairmont was acquired by two companies and its shares ceased to be publicly traded. This acquisition of control could have frustrated the parties\u2019 intention that no entity would realize a foreign exchange gain or loss in connection with the reciprocal loan arrangements. A tax and accounting plan was created that would have allowed the companies to complete the acquisition and continue the full hedge of the foreign exchange exposure. However, this plan was modified before implementation with the result that certain foreign exchange exposure was not hedged.\n\nIn 2007, Legacy asked Fairmont to terminate the reciprocal loan arrangements on an urgent basis so that the Washington and Seattle hotels could be sold. A Fairmont officer mistakenly believed that the original 2006 plan had been implemented (i.e., the plan that continued the full hedge of the foreign exchange exposure) and agreed to the unwinding of the loans (which involved the redemption of certain preferred shares of the subsidiaries involved in the loan arrangements). Subsequently, the CRA reviewed the transactions and reassessed on the basis that the 2007 share redemptions triggered a foreign exchange gain.\n\nFairmont brought an application to rectify the 2007 share redemptions and to substitute a loan arrangement. Fairmont argued that its intent from 2002 was to have the original reciprocal loan arrangements unwound on a tax-neutral basis. In response, the Crown argued that Fairmont had never intended the proposed substituted loan arrangement and thus was engaged in retroactive tax planning.\n\nFairmont relied on the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Juliar for the principle that the exact method to achieve a common intention to avoid tax is not required at the time of the transaction. In response, the Crown argued that the Alberta Court of Queens\u2019 Bench in Graymar Equipment (2008) Inc. v A.G. (Canada) (2014 ABQB 154) had been critical of Juliar and had stated that rectification is granted to restore a transaction to its original purpose and not to avoid an unintended effect.\n\nHowever, in the present case, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated that, unlike the Alberta court, Ontario courts \u201cdo not have the luxury of ignoring\u201d the Ontario Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Juliar. Further, the Ontario court stated that the Alberta court had not accurately described what happened in Juliar, and that another recent Alberta decision had in fact followed the reasoning in Juliar.\n\nIn the present case, the Ontario court held that Fairmont\u2019s intention from 2002 was to carry out the reciprocal loan arrangements on a tax- and accounting-neutral basis so that any foreign exchange gain would be offset by a corresponding foreign exchange loss. This intention remained unchanged when Fairmont was sold in 2006 and when the reciprocal loans were unwound in 2007. A mistake had caused the unintended tax assessments.\n\nThe Court also stated that this was not a situation in which the taxpayer was engaging in retroactive tax planning after a CRA audit. The parties intended to unwind the loans on a tax-free basis.\n\nThe Court allowed the application and rectified the corporate resolutions as requested. The Court awarded $30,000 of costs to the Applicants."

    "Content": "Biometric security is under the spotlight after a hacker claimed to have \u201ccloned\u201d the thumbprint of the German defence minister using nothing more than commercial software and a photograph.\n\nThe development, if proven, will worry experts already concerned at the security implications of using fingerprints for authentication purposes.\n\nCloned Fingerprint\n\nThe fingerprint claim was made by a member of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) hacker network. According to the BBC, Jan Krissler said he replicated the fingerprint of German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen using high res pictures taken with a \u201cstandard photo camera\u201d.\n\nA YouTube video of his demonstration (in German) is available here.\n\nKrissler is also known as Starbug and was speaking at a convention for members of the CCC. He reportedly said he had no physical print from von der Leyen, but has suggested that \u201cpoliticians will presumably wear gloves when talking in public\u201d after hearing about his research.\n\nIt is not known at this stage if he managed to produce an exact replicate of the German politician\u2019s fingerprint.\n\nKrissler claimed to have obtained a copy of von der Leyen\u2019s fingerprint using a close-up photo of her thumb during a press conference. He also used other pictures taken at different angles to build up her fingerprint using software called VeriFinger.\n\nFingerprint identification is used as a security measure on a number of mobile handsets, but for years now experts have warned that fingerprints are not particularly secure.\n\nFingerprint Hacks\n\nIn September for example, mobile security firm Lookout warned that the iPhone 6 could be hacked with a fake fingerprint.\n\nLookout revealed how a fingerprint of the phone user from a glass surface was photographed \u2013 first with 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) resolution. The image was then tidied up, inverted and laser-printed at 1,200dpi onto a transparent sheet with a thick toner setting. Next, white woodglue was smeared into the pattern created by the toner on the sheet. Once set, the print was lifted from the sheet, breathed on to add some moisture, then placed onto the sensor to unlock the phone. Lookout\u2019s recommendation is to introduce two-factor authentication.\n\nAnd earlier in the year, ethical hackers showed how simple it was to bypass Samsung Galaxy S5 fingerprint authentication. The researchers from Security Research Labs (SRLabs) re-used a fingerprint mould from their exploitation of the Apple iPhone 5S in 2013, which required \u201cno additional effort whatsoever\u201d. The fake print was based on a camera phone photo \u201cof an unprocessed latent print on a smartphone screen\u201d.\n\n\u201cBiometrics that rely on static information like face recognition or fingerprints \u2013 it\u2019s not trivial to forge them but most people have accepted that they are not a great form of security because they can be faked,\u201d cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University was quoted by the BBC as saying.\n\n\u201cPeople are starting to look for things where the biometric is alive \u2013 vein recognition in fingers, gait [body motion] analysis \u2013 they are also biometrics but they are chosen because the person has to be in possession of them and exhibiting them in real life,\u201d he reportedly said.\n\nLove security?

    "Title": "Calculating AirAsia payouts for victims: A grim task",
    "Content": "Like in any plane crash, the tragedy over AirAsia Flight 8501 now leads to the horrific task of determining how to compensate the families of the victims.\n\nInternational treaties play a role. Families can also pursue potentially larger claims through the courts. And where victims file lawsuits can play a significant role in determining compensation.\n\nAirAsia Flight 8501, which left Indonesia for Singapore with 162 people on board, disappeared Sunday for reasons that have yet to be determined. Debris from the plane was found in the waters off Indonesia on Tuesday, and rescue officials have started recovering bodies.\n\nThe compensation process tends to be long. In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing in March, families have received some initial payments but final amounts have yet to be settled.\n\nWhat can Flight 8501 families expect? This week, legal experts said it's too soon to determine how much survivors of the victims of AirAsia Flight 8501 will be compensated.\n\nInsurance companies, which typically make the payments, use a range of factors in their calculations. The formula includes pain suffered by those on board, as well as their age, any dependents and their earning potential.\n\n\"It's difficult to come up with a number but a good average in this part of the world would be $2 million or $3 million per passenger -- that's a fairly conservative estimate,\" said Peter Schmitz, global aviation practice leader at insurance company Aon.\n\nSchmitz gave an initial estimate for total loss at about $200 million. But he also said his forecast could vary by as much as $100 million, as more is learned about the passenger makeup and crash.\n\nThe costs are typically borne by a number of insurance companies because of a practice called reinsurance. Essentially, the risk that one company would have to make a huge payment is spread out among numerous insurers. In the case of AirAsia 8501, German giant Allianz is the lead reinsurer.\n\nHow do the treaties work? An international treaty known as the Montreal Convention creates a system of airline liability for injuries and deaths. It guarantees a minimum level of compensation for families -- currently about $174,000.\n\nBut the Montreal Convention is only valid in countries that have ratified it. Indonesia, the departure country for AirAsia 8501, never signed it.\n\nThat could make it difficult, but not impossible, for families to invoke it.\n\nAviation lawyer Brian Alexander, partner at Kreindler & Kreindler, explained that since Singapore is a party to the 1999 Montreal Convention, any passenger traveling round trip to and from Singapore would be covered.\n\nThere's also another treaty in play: The Warsaw Convention, an older agreement that Indonesia has ratified. But it sets a lower payout, said aviation attorney Mike Danko.\n\nHowever, AsiaAir could decide to offer settlements above and beyond either treaty, perhaps in exchange for a pledge not to sue the airline for more damages.\n\n\"Typically it's such a public relations nightmare not to offer a higher amount,\" Danko said.\n\nIn fact, AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes reportedly told media earlier this week that the airline will provide \"some financial assistance\" and not \"hide behind any convention,\" according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAsiaAir did not respond to a request for comment on the compensation issue.\n\nWill cases end up in U.S. courts? Families can also bring cases against an airplane's manufacturer or another third party if evidence supports the claim, according to Alexander.\n\nAnd where a claim is filed could dramatically alter the level of compensation.\n\n\"A U.S. court might set fair compensation for the loss of a spouse at several million dollars,\" wrote Danko in a blog post, \"but an Indonesian court is likely to set fair compensation at far less.\"\n\nBecause neither the carrier nor manufacturer are American companies, and none of the passengers have been identified as American, odds are this disaster won't go before a U.S. court, experts said.\n\nBut if a link to the U.S. can be established -- for example, if a part of the plane determined to have caused the accident was made in America -- that could open the door to the American legal system, said Danko.\n\n\"You could attempt to sue the manufacturer in the U.S. and get a court to evaluate your loss. Your best bet at getting the highest compensation for a wrongful death is here in the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nRelated:\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370: How much will families be paid?\n\nPassengers' families could collect millions\n\n--Virginia Harrison reported from London and Kathryn Vasel reported from New York."

    "Content": "The New Zealand stock market welcomed 16 companies to the bourse in 2014, raising $8.3 billion in equity capital and trumping a 2013 year that had been the busiest for listings in a decade.\n\nInitial public offerings added $6.6 billion of new capital to the stock market this year existing listed companies raised more than $1.7 billion via 165 capital raisings. Investors were drawn to a market where the benchmark NZX 50 Index is heading for an 18 percent annual gain, the third straight year of double-digit growth.\n\n\"It's many, many, many more than we've had for many years, if not ever,\" said Mark Lister, head of private wealth research at Craigs Investment Partners. \"So, lots of new companies coming to market and the market is performing very, very well.\"\n\nThe performance of the new listings has been mixed, with eight of the 16 up on the year, seven down and one unchanged. The biggest gainer was mobile payment app developer Pushpay Holdings, which advanced 84 percent to $2.73 since listing in August, followed by a 49 percent gain in cinema software Vista Group International, up 49 percent to $3.80 since its August debut, and a 40 percent rise to 28 cents for NZAX-listed Lateral Corp, whose mobile technology directly charges services to a customer's phone bill rather than their credit card.\n\nThe worst performer of the new listings was accounting software reseller Enprise Group, whose shares have dropped 18 percent to 45 cents since its regulatory listing on the NZAX this month. Utilities and airports software developer Gentrack's shares have dropped 15 percent to $2.13 since its June listing, while remote measuring tool developer ikeGPS has declined 13 percent to 86 cents.\n\nGenesis Energy, the last of the government's partially privatised power companies, is up 19 percent to $2.145 since its April listing, while health software developer Orion Health Group was down 8.3 percent to $5.75 since its debut last month.\n\nNew Zealand has been an attractive destination for foreign investors with 2014 growth forecast at about 3.5 percent compared to 2.4 percent for the US and 2.5 percent for Australia while the central bank's official cash rate of 3.5 percent compares to zero to 0.25 percent for the Federal Reserve, zero to 0.1 percent for the Bank of Japan and 2.5 for the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\n\"From a GDP perspective we're pretty strong and the government fiscal position is pretty robust, and it's a high-yielding market, so it's all really in favour from an international perspective,\" said James Lindsay, who helps manage $400 million in equities for Nikko Asset Management. \"That's why international investors have been lapping up New Zealand assets, both bonds and equities, because of that running yield.\"\n\nWith two days left of trading, Chorus is the stand-out on the benchmark index, up 84 percent to $2.65. The telecommunications network operator recovered this year after being pummelled last year at the height of regulatory uncertainty over how much it can charge on its copper lines as it builds a nationwide fibre network.\n\nMeridian Energy is next in line, up 69 percent this year to $1.725 after the National-led government's victory in the September general election meant removed the threat of a central power buying agency that was being promised by opposition political parties. MightyRiverPower, the first of last year's partial privatisations, rose 42 percent to $2.98.\n\nAir New Zealand is up 65 percent to $2.58 after the airline beat profit expectations and declared a special dividend this year, and has been given a tailwind in recent months as plunging oil prices make jet fuel cheaper.\n\nThe worst performer on the benchmark index this year has been accounting software developer Xero, which is down 50 percent to $16.25. The firm has been a darling of the stock market in recent years, and peaked at $44.98 in March, but has since fallen out of favour as investors question its ability to break into the US market.\n\nPacific Edge is down 36 percent to 85 cents, also peaking in March before getting caught in a global sell-off of biotech and software firms.\n\nCraigs' Lister said Pacific Edge and Xero have been strong performers in the past, and \"that's part and parcel when you're in that growth phase - you can have an exceptionally strong period and then a weak period and it all sort of events out over time.\"\n\nKathmandu Holdings is down 39 percent this year to $2.13 after a profit warning last week sent the stock to a two-year low after a subdued start to the Christmas trading period in its Australian market.\n\nThe outdoor equipment chain isn't the only retailer to struggle this year, with children's clothing group Pumpkin Patch down 75 percent to 22 cents as it overhauls its business to remain solvent, and clothing chain Hallenstein Glasson falling 19 percent to $3.15.\n\nAcross the NZX All Index, financial software developer Finzsoft Solutions is poised to top the market with an 852 percent gain to $4 after signing its biggest deal which it expects will more than quadruple annual profit. The firm plans to pay its first dividend in four years, and is facing a takeover by managing director and majority shareholder Andrew Holliday in conjunction with Singapore-listed IT firm Silverlake Axis.\n\nAt the bottom of the index is Bathurst Resources, whose shares have plunged 85 percent to 3.2 cents after the would-be coal miner trimmed its board size and clamped down on costs while it waits for the global coking coal price to improve.\n\nWhile the local stock market has had its biggest year of listings, operator NZX has also embarked on plans to roll out more exchange traded funds - a way for investors to passively track an index of securities - in the coming year, buying fund manager SuperLife for as much as $35 million.\n\nThe stock market operator also plans to introduce a new growth market, NXT, early next year, giving small and medium sized businesses the opportunity to go public without the same disclosure obligations as the main board.\n\nCraigs' Lister said 2015 will likely be more volatile, and while the market may report another positive year, returns will probably fall back to the long term average of 6 or 7 percent.\n\n\"We're telling our clients to expect a more difficult year next year, and be a little bit more careful,\" Lister said. \"If people acknowledge those risks and realise things can't go up at a 15 or 20 percent pace forever, then at least they'll be prepared for things to be a bit tougher.\"\n\nStill, Lister said New Zealand's corporate sector is in \"really good shape\" and there should be more IPOs and opportunities in 2015 to broaden investors' choices.\n\n(BusinessDesk)"

The party wants to cancel austerity and a big chunk of national debt but says it will keep Greece in the euro zone.\n\nThe head of Germany's influential Ifo economic research institute, Hans-Werner Sinn, meanwhile called a Greek exit from the euro zone an option.\n\n\"Further debt cuts will be needed again and again, unless the country is released from the euro zone and allowed to regain its competitiveness by devaluation,\" he told German daily Tagesspiegel.\n\nOn Monday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned Greece against straying from a path of economic reform, saying any new government in Athens would be held to the pledges made by the current government of premier Antonis Samaras.\n\nReuters"

    "Title": "Red-light cameras fade as speed cams get green light",
    "Content": "NEWARK, N.J. \u2014 Motorists rejoicing over decisions to discontinue unpopular red-light camera programs don\u2019t have to drive too far for a buzzkill.\n\nThe number of red-light cameras nationwide is falling because of opposition from lawmakers and average Joes \u2014 but the use of cameras to catch speeders is slowly rising, potentially signaling a new battleground.\n\nThe number of U.S. communities using red-light cameras has fallen 13 percent, to 469, since the end of 2012, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit scientific and educational organization funded by the insurance industry. That includes the 24 towns in New Jersey that participated in a pilot program that ended this month with no pending legislation to revive it.\n\nMeanwhile, the institute estimates that 137 communities use speed cameras, up from 115 at the end of 2011.\n\nAdvocates for cameras that catch red-light runners point to data showing they reduce accidents, while critics note they can\u2019t employ judgment to distinguish between, say, a red-light run during rush hour in a school zone and a technically illegal right turn on a red light at 3 a.m. Speeding, however, is a bit more black and white when it comes to cameras.\n\n\u201cThe goal of these advocates for the red-light cameras was a one-two punch,\u201d said New Jersey state Sen. Michael Doherty, an opponent. \u201cThey\u2019d come in with the red-light cameras and expand to speeding cameras.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s red-light program was beset with problems: a yellow-light timing controversy that caused the cameras to be shut down temporarily; a computer glitch that voided thousands of tickets; and a federal lawsuit initiated by one resident that led to refunds for hundreds of thousands of motorists.\n\nTraffic cameras have also been contentious in Ohio, where the governor signed a bill this month requiring a police officer to be present for traffic-camera citations, something camera proponents say negates the practicality of using them to stretch police resources.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to me,\u201d said Adam Loukx, city law director for Toledo. \u201cIt seems worse than whatever they thought they were curing.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, who sponsored the bill, said cameras can have their benefits in areas such as school zones, but they too often have resulted in needless ticketing for harmless offenses.\n\n\u201cI think the cities took a kernel of a good idea and put it on steroids and managed to anger a significant amount of the population,\u201d Seitz said.\n\nCritics also charge that towns are more interested in revenue than improving safety. Toledo resident Joel Clark said it\u2019s clear to him that the cameras are money makers.\n\n\u201cThey know where to put them to make the money,\u201d he said. \u201cMy buddy got four in a week before he knew the camera was there. That\u2019s what, $500? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nSome consider the cameras a valuable safety tool, despite missteps.\n\n\u201cThe research is clear that photo enforcement works,\u201d said Russ Rader, IIHS senior vice president. \u201cIt\u2019s effective in reducing violations and in reducing crashes, both red-light cameras and speed cameras. There is no question that lives will be lost because New Jersey has decided to end the program.\u201d\n\nExcept for parts of the Midwest, both types of cameras can be hard to avoid. A motorist could take a southwestern route from New Jersey to California and pass through only one state \u2014 Mississippi \u2014 where neither form of camera is in use.\n\nThe three states bordering New Jersey all use some form of traffic enforcement cameras, as do nearly half of all states.\n\nIn Arizona, speed cameras were used for two years on state highways before Gov. Jan Brewer banned them in 2010. Speeding and red-light cameras are still used in some municipalities after legislative attempts to ban them failed. The state also has struggled with a ticketing system that requires people who ignore mailed violations to be personally served if the case is to proceed.\n\nBoth types of cameras have been challenged in courts nationwide. The day before Ohio\u2019s bill was signed, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 to uphold for a second time camera use by municipalities. The cameras also survived high court challenges in California and Illinois this year, and a ruling is pending in Missouri, where justices heard arguments this month on cases originating in three communities, including St. Louis.\n\nThey didn\u2019t survive in Nassau County on New York\u2019s Long Island, where speed cameras were installed in nearly two dozen school locations this year. The county had to forgive more than $2 million in fines due to equipment problems, and in December the county legislature voted unanimously to repeal the program."

Two of those bodies have been flown to Surabaya for identification.\n\nThe search area was narrowed to 120 square nautical miles and 22 ships continued to hunt for the remaining victims and for the plane's black box, said Putranto.\n\nBut the agonizing wait could be a long one for family members and rescue workers.\n\n\"The clouds are very low in the target area,\" Sandi said. \"Everyone is praying for more friendly weather.\"\n\n(Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Mike Collett-White)"

    "Title": "In 2014, racial tension over policing reached a breaking point",
    "Content": "It was a year of grand juries and smashed windows, of tear gas and video evidence, and of boisterous demands for police reform in Los Angeles, New York, Oakland and Ferguson, Mo., as crowds cried, \"Black lives matter.\"\n\nIt was the year in which a black Staten Island, N.Y., man suspected of selling untaxed cigarettes, Eric Garner, died after an altercation with police; the officer accused of putting him in an unauthorized chokehold was not indicted. Ohio police were similarly absolved after fatally shooting John Crawford III in a Wal-Mart after he picked up a BB gun while talking on the phone with his girlfriend. Elsewhere in Ohio, a Cleveland police officer fatally shot a 12-year-old boy who was carrying a toy gun in a park, a death the state medical examiner ruled a homicide.\n\nIt was the year two police officers were shot dead in their patrol car in Brooklyn solely because of the uniforms they wore, and of a solemn funeral afterward at which hundreds of New York Police Department officers turned their backs on the mayor of the nation's largest city, who had said he'd told his mixed-race son to be wary of the police for his own safety.\n\nIn city after city, 2014 became a year in which the nation's lingering racial fissures burst open from the strain of a fundamental disagreement over the nature and purpose of policing, especially in African American communities.\n\nMore so than teachers, tax collectors or elected officials, police officers are often the most visible representatives of the government \u2014 and its policies \u2014 on the streets of black communities across the country, which remain widely disadvantaged both economically and politically.\n\nEugene O'Neill, a former NYPD officer and prosecutor who is a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, put the role of police in terms of political philosophy: \"They use force on people, they are agents of coercion, they are surrogates sent there on our behalf.\"\n\nBut while the role of officers to use force to protect life and property is a universal feature of American government, polls have shown that the degree of public trust in the police is politically polarized largely by skin color and, to a somewhat lesser extent, political affiliation.\n\nThat political friction has long existed in American life, so when black activists this year likened the arrival of widespread protests to a new civil rights movement, their grievances centered on and came face to face with an old foe: the police.\n\nThe latest tumultuous chapter in America's racial history can be traced back to a few moments on Aug. 9.\n\nThat's when 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, was shot and killed by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, after a struggle and a foot chase through the predominantly black St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.\n\nOfficer-involved shootings, even of unarmed victims, happen all the time, but it's unclear exactly how often, though some estimates put the number at least in the hundreds. Small protests or calls for reform afterward are common.\n\nSo why did Ferguson come to be a launching point for months of intense dissent? Some observers pointed to the predominantly black city's overwhelmingly white political leadership and police force, both of which were quickly overwhelmed by the duration and intensity of the protests that claimed its streets.\n\nThen there was the high drama of St. Louis-area police agencies using tear gas and intimidating force in failing to quell often, but not always, peaceful demonstrations, in which every passing day seemed to bring some kind of escalation.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon, who ordered a state of emergency and twice called in the state National Guard, created a commission to study the roots of Ferguson's civic crisis.\n\nOutgoing U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr., who is black, took a special interest in Ferguson, to the pique of some police unions who thought he was being too critical of ground-level law enforcement.\n\nFederal officials descended on the suburb to open an investigation into the shooting and the practices of local police departments; the U.S. Justice Department also will continue to investigate various police departments to check for patterns of civil rights violations.\n\nA running theme in the year's debate over policing has been understanding \u2014 or the lack of it.\n\nProtesters in Ferguson and elsewhere repeatedly said police and the rest of officialdom do not understand the pressures, challenges and dangers facing black Americans.\n\n\"Insurance is high, gas is high, but that's not why I get mad,\" Ferguson demonstrator Ricky Jones, 34, said during one of the first nights of the uprising in August. \"At the end of the day, when I'm driving home, they ask me to pull over and get out of the car. No 'license and registration, please.' 'Get out of the car. Lay on the ground. Put your hands on your head.'\"\n\nPolice, for their part, say they are misunderstood too.\n\n\"There is a very pervasive feeling in law enforcement ... that the politicians are not supporting us,\" said Chuck Canterbury, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which has 325,000 members. \"Law enforcement is the only arm of government that is ever asked to do anything about [troubled] communities. The politicians are the ones saying, 'Get in there and stop that crime.' And then, when an incident happens, they rush to judgment that police were wrong.\"\n\nThe opposing accounts of what happened the day Michael Brown died seem to capture the divide that will no doubt continue as debate continues on tactics, body cameras and shooting investigations.\n\nSome witnesses said Brown had his hands up when he was shot. Wilson told investigators Brown was charging at him to attack.\n\nIt was a basic disagreement of fact that would foreshadow the much larger debate looming for the nation \u2014 on what it means to be black in America, or to be a police officer in America, in which voices from both sides would claim to be betrayed and, most of all, deeply misunderstood.\n\nmatt.pearce@latimes.com"

    "Title": "Maybe raise a glass of craft beer this New Year's Eve",
    "Content": "In 2014 beer began to get more of the respect it deserves as a serious beverage that delivers serious flavor to those willing to dive into the sea of styles and varieties. Why not celebrate beer\u2019s new-found respect by ringing in the new year with some malted barley beverages instead of the staid sparkling wines?\n\nFor under $30 (usually well under) you can pick up a large-format bottle of craft-brewed or imported beer that will be as at home in a festive champagne glass as any bargain-bin bubbly. Picking a bottle isn\u2019t tough; here are suggestions for styles and bottles to share on the holiday.\n\nThe Champagne of beers\n\nBright, dry, and festively effervescent, these bottles of (usually) golden ale are treated to a special refermentation and conditioning process akin to what traditional Champagne goes through. The result is a refined and complex glass that will beguile those grape fans who claim to dislike beer. A classic example is DeuS from Brouwerij Bostells, while Malheur Brut Noir is a curiously dark and fruity version of the emergent style. Some American craft breweries \u2014 like Missouri's acclaimed Side Project Brewing \u2014 are beginning to experiment with the style, and perhaps by New Year\u2019s 2016 there will be more craft brewed options for such beverages.\n\nBelgian-style beers\n\nIf you find yourself in a liquor store stumped by what bottle of bubbly to buy for the party, take a trip to the Belgian beer aisle instead. The classic abbey-style ales have the refinement, the class, and the booze to fill the flutes of the midnight toast. Tripel Karmeliet is a perfect choice \u2014 it\u2019s spicy and dry with a great depth of flavor and a beautiful presence in the glass. If you\u2019re looking for something even a bit stronger (in alcohol and in flavor profile) try a dark, heavy quadrupel like the Saint Bernardus ABT12. A classic American-brewed example of the tripel is Curieux from Maine\u2019s Allagash Brewing. Curieux starts off as a bright and peppery golden ale before getting an extended rest in used bourbon barrels, and the result is one of the most iconic brews in the craft beer world. The recently released 10th anniversary magnum bottles of the brew are a perfect bottle to pop during your celebrations.\n\nHigher alcohol beers\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the explosion of craft breweries are the bold beers that push past the 10% alcohol mark and have the bombastic flavors to match all that booze. Imperial stouts, double (and triple) IPAs, and American-style (read: more hoppy) barleywines are all fitting libations to accompany the start of a new year. Look for the Holiday 2014 ale from Temecula\u2019s Black Market Brewing Co. The beer is a triple black rye IPA that comes in at over 11% alcohol and will pelt your palate with pungent hop flavors and a burly malt body. Stout lovers can hoist a snifter of inky Barrel Aged Old Rasputin from North Coast Brewing or the coffee-tinged Speedway Stout from Alesmith Brewing. You know that special bottle that you\u2019ve been saving for just the right special occasion? The New Year\u2019s Eve party might be just the excuse you\u2019ve been looking for to crack it open.\n\nSour beers\n\nSour beer continues to captivate drinkers, and \u2014 especially in Los Angeles \u2014 2015 looks to be the year of sour beer. There are as many different varieties of sour brews as there are tongues to taste them, and one of the most approachable sour ales \u2014 the light and tart Berliner Weisse \u2014 was even called \u201cthe Champagne of the north\u201d by Napoleon Bonaparte a couple of centuries ago. The more complex sour brown ales of Flanders make for more festive toasts, and the special bottles of Rodenbach Gran Cru are particularly good for a celebratory salute. The delicately fruited lambics from Brouwerij Boon or Drie Fonteinen will also fill a champagne flute with aplomb."

    "Content": "If a New Year comes, can wish lists be far behind? Here is one that is short and simple \u2014 cut out the clutter. There is a new government with a decisive mandate. There is renewed hope about the India story. But over the past few months, there has also been a parallel narrative. There are conflicting signals, leading even some of the most ardent supporters of the Modi government, to question whether the important has been replaced by the irrelevant, a consequence of distractions by the Sangh Parivar and its ideological affiliates. Many Modi sceptics question whether the Hindutva agenda is really a choreographed side-show as some would like to believe or the main mission?\n\nThese are fair questions given the mixed signals \u2014 the nub of the problem. As marketers never tire of pointing out, cut out the clutter. If Brand India wants to position itself as the hope, growth and development story, it has to cut out everything which distracts and threatens the main mission of achieving higher economic growth and development that is regionally and socially inclusive.\n\nEconomic growth that is sustainable and equitable requires a conducive, social and political environment. But what do we see on the ground? Over the past week, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad claims to have converted more than 60 Christians to Hinduism in Kottayam, Kerala. In Karnataka, the Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha is reportedly planning a similar programme. On the other hand, in Gaya, Bihar, at least 40 Mahadalit families have reportedly embraced Chris-tianity in recent days. And Orissa police are investigating if a dozen odd tribal families in Sundargarh have been forced to convert to Christianity from Hinduism.\n\nWhat does all this do to Brand India? Prime Minister Modi insists that development and good governance \u201care the only ways ahead\u201d. Where does \u201cghar wapsi\u201d, reconversion of non-Hindus back into the Hindu fold, fit into this vision? Is \u201cghar wapsi\u201d one of India\u2019s top priorities? Or should the nation\u2019s energy be spent on steps that make everyone\u2019s \u201cghar\u201d strong and more liveable so that the mass religious conversions of all sorts lose their lure? Will the Prime Minister tell us what he thinks about this polarising debate?\n\nPrime Minister Modi\u2019s supporters say these are issues raked up by \u201cleft-liberals\u201d who habitually critique everything that the new government says or does. But people like economist Surjit Bhalla, an ardent champion of free markets, don\u2019t quite fit this image. In a column in a newspaper last month, Mr Bhalla exasperatedly asked, \u201cGood god, what can we expect in January?\u201d The reference was to the cascade of controversies over issues which have little or no bearing on the government\u2019s professed economic and development agenda. Well, January is here and we have learnt to live with fog. But the fog in the messaging needs to go.\n\nAs we roll out the welcome mat to 2015, we need to focus on the big picture \u2014 where is India headed and where will competitive evangelism with its agonising cycle of conversions and reconversions take us? Can the economy soar if there is social and political turmoil? What are the really important discussions we need to have and what can wait? In a country where tens of thousands of schools are without basic minimum facilities and which still has a large illiterate population, is teaching of Sanskrit the immediate worry? If economic growth and inclusive development are the two key national priorities, then all issues that have no bearing on these have to be put on the back-burner.\n\nThe next step is to go beyond slogans. The National Democratic Alliance government has been quick to create attractive slogans. Slogan driven activity surrounding \u201cachhe din\u201d, \u201cAb Ki Bar, Modi sarkar\u201d, \u201cMake in India\u201d, \u201cSwachh Bharat\u201d and now \u201cGood Governance\u201d have found a clear connect with large swathes of the population. But now is the time to go beyond slogans and focus on the specifics.\n\nTake the buzz word of the day \u2014 good governance. This implies being transparent about the choices and trade-offs. What is being given up and for whose benefit? As I write, there is controversy over a cut in the health budget. Health ministry officials are speaking in different voices to the media \u2014 some saying there has been a cut, and some saying no. We need to know the truth. Especially since India has among the lowest public health expenditures in the world. Though India has marginally improved its score on infant mortality, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) shows that one of every 25 Indian infants still die within one year of birth. It is amply clear that the government must spend more on public healthcare. If there is likely to be less money for health and right across the social sector because past allocations have not been spent, the government \u2014 both Centre and state \u2014 need to tell us why this is so and what is being done to improve capacity to use allocated resources?\n\nThen there are socio-cultural issues which continue to be a blot on Brand India. Like the skewed sex ratio. The latest SRS shows that sex ratio at birth has improved by a point to 909 from 2010-12 to 2011-13. But what is worrying is the child sex ratio in the 0-4 age group. After being stable at 914 from 2007-09 to 2009-11, the child sex ratio (age group 0-4) for the country has decreased to 909 in 2011-2013. There are other challenges \u2014 deteriorating environment, lack of quality education, skill development. On each of these, tough choices have to be made and there needs to be a clear prioritising of what is immediate and urgent and what can wait.\n\nAlong with economic growth, these are the real issues of development. These are the litmus tests of good governance. No doubt, there will be battles ahead. But India has to choose which battles are worth fighting to usher in change. Let us hope that 2015 is the year when the change we want is visible on the ground and not just in speeches.\n\n\n\nThe writer focuses on development issues in India and emerging economies.\n\nShe can be reached at patralekha.chatterjee@gmail.com"

The armed forces said the goal was to arrest those suspects.\n\nHuman right organizations have long criticized targeted killings in Afghanistan, which killed hundreds of suspected Taliban members without trial. According Der Spiegel, not only Taliban commanders were targeted, but also suspected drug dealers.\n\nMany of these operations involved drones or helicopters and resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths, according to the weekly. In 2009 alone, around 600 civilians were killed in these operations.\n\nGermany\u2019s military role in Afghanistan has been a sensitive issue in domestic politics as a majority of Germans have been reluctant to see their country involved militarily in international conflicts.\n\nGerman government officials, however, have advocated a more active foreign policy approach, supported by military measures, citing Germany's responsibility for \"international peace and stability.\"\n\nGermany had been one of the key contributors to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan since 2002 and has provided up to 5,350 soldiers, in the country's first international combat operation carried out by its modern, post-WWII army.\n\nFifty-five German soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan, 35 of them in attacks or during military operations.\n\nThe German government has decided last month to keep 850 soldiers in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO\u2019s combat troops at the end of 2014.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, 2015, the NATO-led mission will focus on training and advising Afghan security forces.

    "Title": "Do buffer zones deter wars?",
    "Content": "Lionel Beehner (Photo: File)\n\nThe concept of the buffer zone is making a big comeback in international politics. These zones act as a Switzerland-like neutral territory or demilitarized no man's land, a kind of cordon sanitaire that avoids neighbors staring at each other eyeball to eyeball \u2014 the suburban equivalent of building a higher picket fence.\n\nConsider the crisis in Ukraine. Russia fears that Kiev might seek NATO membership, which would effectively put it in the West's sphere of influence and give Russia less leverage over a strategic chunk of land that has historically buffered it from the rest of Europe. One of its justifications for recently seizing the Crimea and much of Ukraine's eastern half is Vladimir Putin's desire for more cushion separating Russia from NATO.\n\nAs Notre Dame's Tanisha Fazal has argued, buffer states such as Ukraine are the country's most at risk of suffering \"state death.\"\n\n\"If (great powers) fail to act against the buffer,\" she writes, \"they fear that their opponent will take it over in their stead.\"\n\nTurkey-Syria overlap\n\nLikewise, Turkey sees the violence in Syria spilling over its border. Ankara has pressed Washington to provide a buffer zone across northern Syria, akin to the one installed in northern Iraq in 1991, which stemmed the tide of refugees and buffered Turkey from the Iraqi violence against the Kurdish minorities.\n\nBuffer zones, of course, are not new. Think back to the turn-of-the-century days of Pancho Villa, when cross-border incursions between Mexico and the United States were routine.\n\nHistorically, buffer zones range in scope. In some cases, they just entail a kind of gentlemen's agreement between neighbors to temporarily violate the other's border in \"pursuit\" of terrorists, outlaws or bandits. Iraq and Turkey struck such a deal in the late 1980s that allowed for a few-mile joint security zone into which both could march. Ditto Sudan and Uganda in the 1990s.\n\nYet these zones' historical record at keeping the peace is mixed.\n\nOn one hand, they can create political wiggle room to let tensions diffuse and act as a confidence-building measure. The DMZ that divides North Korea from South Korea has prevented war for more than a half-century. Buffer zones have tentatively worked to maintain the uneasy peace between Israel and Egypt and Syria over the past few decades. (Interestingly, the one place in the Middle East with no real buffer in place is within Israel itself, which is partly why violence with the Palestinians rekindles every few years.)\n\nOn the other hand, they can \"freeze\" conflicts in place, negating the need to negotiate peace. Nobody would argue the Korean Peninsula is a safe place. Moreover, to enact a no-fly zone is legally an act of war.\n\nA Band-Aid solution\n\nIn terms of diffusing the crises in Syria and Ukraine, a buffer zone, while attractive, is at best a Band-Aid solution. If Russia gobbles up Ukraine's eastern flank, that might prevent a wider war tomorrow, but it could just postpone conflict for another day.\n\nSimilarly in Syria, a no-fly zone might ease tensions with Turkey in the short term, but that does not arrest the violence or do anything to bring President Bashar Assad to the table.\n\nLast week, a Jordanian pilot on a mission in northern Syria to attack an Islamic State site was captured after his jet was shot down or had mechanical difficulty. The idea of wrapping states in bubble wrap merely creates the illusion of peace.\n\nOne might argue that the alternatives could be worse because they would entail providing one side -- whether the regime in Ukraine or the rebels in Syria \u2014 with a military lifeline to tip the war in its favor, all the while tiptoeing around the awkward fact that nobody will put down boots on the ground. The logic by some is to just hand Russia its share of Ukraine and give Turkey its buffer zone as a way to stem the tide of refugees and to \"contain\" the conflict.\n\nThat might sound attractive. But consider our own troubled border with Mexico. We inked a treaty way back in 1882 allowing both sides to pursue marauding bands of Native Americans across the other's border. But that did nothing to prevent the U.S. from invading Mexico during its civil war in 1916. A buffer zone is no substitute for peace or a policy of deterrence.\n\nLionel Beehner, editor of Cicero Magazine, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/www.baxterbulletin.com\/story\/opinion\/2014\/12\/31\/lionel-beehner-buffer-zones-deter-wars\/21116839\/"

    "Title": "With growing terror threats, instability stares most of Asia",
    "Content": "With growing terror threats, instability stares most of Asia\n\nGurmeet Kanwal, Jan 1, 2015, DHNS:\n\nThe gruesome terrorist strike on hapless school children in Peshawar on December 16, 2014, once again underlined the dark reality that the Af-Pak region is the terror centre of Southern Asia. In fact, the region is the second most unstable region in the world and is competing closely with West Asia for the number one spot.\n\n\n\nBoth China and Pakistan have become militarily more assertive on India\u2019s borders. Chinese transgressions into Demchok and Chumar in Ladakh cast a shadow on President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to India. Chinese intransigence on demarcating the Line of Actual Control continues. Quite inexplicably, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts at reaching out to the SAARC leaders, the Pakistan army under General Raheel Sharif repeatedly violated the ceasefire agreement and once again stepped up the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC.\n\n\n\nThe single greatest cause of an unstable regional security environment is the conflict in Afghanistan and the areas along the Hindukush Range astride the Durand Line. The present security situation can be characterised as a stalemate. With the drawdown of NATO-ISAF forces by year end, the situation is likely to deteriorate further.\n\n\n\nThe Afghan National Army (ANA) has assumed responsibility for security, but does not yet possess the professional standards necessary to prevail over the increasingly resurgent Taliban. The remaining US forces will \u2018train, advise and assist\u2019 the ANA. However, they are likely to continue to launch air and drone strikes in Pakistan against extremists sheltering in the Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa and FATA areas against Al Qaeda terrorists. A gradual drift into civil war appears to be the most likely outcome.\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s half-hearted struggle against the remnants of the al Qaeda and the home grown Taliban like the TTP and the TNSM, fissiparous tendencies in Balochistan, continuing radical extremism and creeping Talibanisation in the heartland, tentative efforts towards counter-terrorism, the floundering economy and, consequently, the nation\u2019s gradual slide towards becoming a \u2018failed state\u2019, pose a major security challenge for the region.\n\n\n\nThe Pakistan army\u2019s campaign against the TTP in North Waziristan is floundering. The army refuses to give up its idiosyncratic notions of \u2018strategic depth\u2019 and \u2018good Taliban\u2019 and continues to sponsor terrorism in India and Afghanistan. Unless it concentrates on eliminating the scourge of terrorism, Pakistan will continue to slide deeper into chaos.\n\n\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s inability to find a lasting solution to its ethnic problems despite the comprehensive defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has serious repercussions for long-term stability in the island nation. The unchecked rise of Islamist fundamentalist terrorism in Bangladesh, even as it struggles for economic upliftment to subsistence levels, could trigger new forces of destruction. Much will depend on how well the government of Sheikh Hasina cooperates with the new government in India to neutralise organisations like HuJI and the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) that operate on both sides of the border.\n\n\n\nNepal\u2019s fledgling democracy is continuing to struggle. The government\u2019s inclination to seek neutrality between India and China is a blow to the historically stable India-Nepal relationship. Simmering discontentment that is gathering momentum in Tibet and Xinjiang against China\u2019s repressive regime has the potential to snowball into a full-blown revolt.\n\n\n\nThe people\u2019s nascent movement for democracy in Myanmar and several long festering insurgencies may destabilise the military Junta despite its post-election confidence. Australia and most South-east Asian nations are apprehensive of the increasing Chinese presence even as US influence appears to be gradually declining. The US pivot to the Indo-Pacific is not yet seen as becoming potentially capable of balancing China.\n\n\n\nWith the newly proclaimed Caliphate astride the Iraq-Syria border that calls itself the Islamic State, turmoil in West Asia is likely to continue. Despite the efforts of the Iraqi forces, the Kurdish Peshmerga and the air strikes being launched by the US and its allies, the IS militia has been gaining ground. The Israel-Palestinian stand-off shows no sign of abating. Israel refuses to halt the construction of new settlements in the West Bank and the Hamas militia is getting increasingly restive.\n\n\n\nIran\u2019s refusal to unambiguously renounce its nuclear ambitions and the vaguely stated threats of several of its neighbours to follow suit are a cause for concern in the region. Saudi Arabia is suspected to be funding Pakistan\u2019s nuclear expansion programme as a hedging strategy against the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran.The collusive nuclear weapons-cum-missile development programme of China, North Korea and Pakistan also causes apprehension.\n\n\n\nSecurity environment\n\nThe Korean military stand-off along the 38th Parallel is a destabilising factor in the precarious security environment in East Asia. This sub-region will remain volatile unless the Chinese use their influence with North Korea to persuade it to back off from the path of confrontation. Increasing Chinese assertiveness over the Senkaku\/Diaoyu islands and in the South China Sea is completely out of character with China\u2019s stated objective of a peaceful rise. Other negative factors impacting regional stability include the unchecked proliferation of small arms being sustained by large-scale narcotics trafficking. India lies between the golden triangle and the golden crescent.\n\n\n\nWith a history of four conflicts in 60 years and three nuclear-armed adversaries with unresolved territorial disputes continuing to face off, Southern Asia has been described as a nuclear flashpoint. India\u2019s standing as a regional power that has global power ambitions and aspires to a permanent seat on the UN Security Council has been seriously compromised by its inability to successfully manage the external conflicts in its neighbourhood, singly or in concert with its strategic partners.\n\n\n\nTogether, the ongoing conflicts are undermining Asia\u2019s efforts towards socio-economic development and poverty alleviation by hampering governance and vitiating the investment climate. A cooperative security framework to unitedly meet future threats and challenges is nowhere in sight.\n\n\n\n(The writer is former Director, Centre for Land Warfare Studies, New Delhi)\n\nGo to Top"

    "Content": "This Thursday, Dec. 4, 2014, file photo shows children gathering to form an image of a tree around a sign that reads in Spanish \"The world we want\" on a beach during the Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru. Low oil prices could paradoxically help the world reach an international agreement to fight global warming, Laurence Tubiana, France's special representative for the 2015 climate conference in Paris said, laying out plans for a binding accord to stem greenhouse gas emissions. Her government will spend 11 months trying to cajole more than 190 countries into overcoming disagreements about acceptable greenhouse gas emissions and who should pay for them, and locking themselves into an accord. (AP Photo\/Martin Mejia, File) Low oil prices could paradoxically help the world reach an international agreement to fight global warming, according to the French ambassador charged with organizing a key climate conference in Paris.\n\nFrance is spending the next 11 months trying to cajole more than 190 countries into overcoming disagreements about acceptable greenhouse gas emissions levels and who should pay to achieve them to produce a binding accord to limit emissions.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, France's special representative for the 2015 climate conference in Paris, says now nations can't cite high energy prices as a reason to avoid taking action.\n\n\"Several years ago, I would have said it (low oil prices) complicates things,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview this week. \"(But) lower energy prices give more maneuvering room for investment and could ultimately allow the introduction of a carbon tax or something that works like one.\"\n\nIn fact, she said, forward-looking governments will be able to use the money saved on oil and gas to develop renewable technologies, rather than increasing their fossil fuel extraction. And lower costs at the pump means consumers will be less opposed to new taxes to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Those taxes, sometimes called carbon taxes, have faced resistance in the United States, but many other countries have adopted some versions of them, using the proceeds to invest in renewable resources.\n\nStill, the argument only carries so far\u2014many environmentalists fear that low oil prices will simply let governments continue their reliance on greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels, while high prices could force them to look elsewhere for energy.\n\nOil prices have plunged by half since June. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.48 to $52.64 a barrel Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nThe ultimate goal of U.N. climate negotiations is to stabilize greenhouse gases at a level that keeps global warming below 2 degrees C (3.6 F), compared with pre-industrial times. For Tubiana, the key to reaching that goal is a legally binding agreement, one incorporated into law or national policy in every country in the world.\n\nNegotiations culminating in the Nov. 30-Dec. 11 meeting in Paris will rise or fall on two key points: How to divide responsibility for global warming and how to pay to fight it. The developed world used fossil fuels to build roads, cities and houses and emerging economies want to have the same chances to grow as quickly as possible. Island nations like Tuvalu and low-lying countries, meanwhile, fear rising sea levels will swamp them and need funds to adjust.\n\nBut, Tubiana said, one set of rules must apply to everyone. And ultimately, low oil prices or not, fossil fuels have to be phased out.\n\n\"We have to change the trajectory of development for all countries, rich or poor,\" she said. \"It is out of the question to pass through a phase of intensive fossil fuel use, then lowering it.\"\n\nCrucially\u2014and potentially most difficult\u2014she said the accord must be legally binding.\n\n\"Otherwise governments can say today they want something, then in three or four years, they can change their minds,\" she said.\n\nThat could prove complicated in the United States, where Congress voted down climate legislation in 2009. President Barack Obama has largely leaned on existing laws to make progress, raising vehicle fuel standards for trucks and proposing stricter controls on power plants but he will leave office in January 2017.\n\nThe U.S. and China, the world's two largest emitters of heat-trapping gases, negotiated secretly for months in 2014 to reach a non-binding climate change agreement but momentum from that deal disintegrated at a conference in Lima, Peru, where a compromise deal was salvaged in December to set up the Paris accord.\n\nIn Lima, China and other major developing countries opposed plans that would allow pledges to be compared against one another before the Paris meeting.\n\nStill, Tubiana was encouraged by some progress in Lima.\n\n\"Every country has agreed to make a contribution. That is very important,\" she said.\n\nExplore further: Australia won't pay to climate fund"

    "Content": "Charles Krauthammer\n\nThere's an old Cold War joke \u2014 pre-pantyhose \u2014 that to defeat communism we should empty our B-52 bombers of nuclear weapons and instead drop nylons over the Soviet Union. Flood the Russians with the soft consumer culture of capitalism, seduce them with contact and commerce, love-bomb them into freedom.\n\nWe did win the Cold War, but differently. We contained, constrained, squeezed and eventually exhausted the Soviets into giving up. The dissidents inside subsequently told us how much they were sustained by our support for them and our implacable pressure on their oppressors.\n\nThe logic behind President Obama's Cuba normalization, assuming there is one, is the nylon strategy. We tried 50 years of containment and that didn't bring democracy. So let's try inundating them with American goods, visitors, culture, contact, commerce.\n\nIt's not a crazy argument. But it has its weaknesses. Normalization has not advanced democracy in China or Vietnam. Indeed, it hasn't done so in Cuba.\n\nExcept for the U.S., Cuba has had normal relations with the rest of the world for decades. Tourists, trade, investment from Canada, France, Britain, Spain, everywhere. An avalanche of nylons \u2014 and not an inch of movement in Cuba toward freedom.\n\nIn fact, one could argue this influx of Western money helped preserve the dictatorship, as just about all financial transactions go through the government, which takes for itself before any trickle-down crumbs are allowed to reach the regime-indentured masses.\n\nMy view is that police-state control of every aspect of Cuban life is so thoroughly perfected that outside influences, whether confrontational or cooperative, only minimally affect the country's domestic trajectory.\n\nSo why not just lift the embargo? After all, the unassailable strategic rationale for isolating Cuba \u2014 in the Soviets' mortal global struggle with us, Cuba enlisted as a highly committed enemy beachhead 90 miles from American shores \u2014 evaporated with the collapse of the Soviet empire. A small island with no significant independent military capacities, Cuba became geopolitically irrelevant.\n\nThat's been partially reversed in the last few years as Vladimir Putin has repositioned Russia as America's leading geopolitical adversary and the Castros signed up for that coalition too.\n\nCuba reportedly has agreed to reopen the Soviet-era Lourdes espionage facility, a massive listening post for intercepting communications. Havana and Moscow have also discussed the use of Cuban airfields for Russia's nuclear-capable long-range bombers.\n\nThis in addition to Cuba's usual hemispheric mischief, such as training and equipping the security and repression apparatus in Venezuela."

    "Content": "Credai head says things are looking up for the city that will host FAIRPRO this week\n\nAn upbeat mood has been prevalent among real estate buyers in Coimbatore, particularly after Diwali and the sentiment is better compared to last year, according to Rajesh B Lund, President, Confederation of Real Estate Developers\u2019 Associations of India (Credai), Coimbatore.\n\nThe association, in an effort to woo NRIs, who account for about 20 per cent of investment in real estate in Coimbatore, is organising its property show-styled FAIRPRO in the city on January 3 and 4, 2015, making it the first time it is organising two FAIRPROs in a year.\n\nSpeaking to media in Coimbatore ahead of the realty fair, he said, \u201cNormally, the annual edition of FAIRPRO is organised during August by CREDAI, Coimbatore. But this year, it decided to hold an additional edition of the property fair at the beginning of the year in January with a view to cater to the requirements of the NRIs coming home for vacation.\n\nLund estimated that NRI buyers accounted for about 20 per cent of the property purchases in Coimbatore. Apart from the districts in Tamil Nadu bordering Coimbatore, people from Palakkad district in neighbouring Kerala also evinced interest in investing in real estate in the city. While conceding that the number of new project launches during 2014 were less in Coimbatore compared to the previous year, he said some of the openings could have been delayed as the promoters would have awaited all statutory approvals before launching them. But the overall status of the realty market here was better compared to many cities.\n\nOn the issue of service tax levy on new property purchases, which pushed up the overall cost of acquisition, he said that as the Government was not inclined to relax the levy, buyers were left with no choice. The developers also had to contend with frequent rise in input costs like the hike in cement prices which upset their project cost calculations and a jump in labour costs, making it difficult for them to cut prices.\n\nLund hoped that with the State Government promising huge investments in infrastructure development in the city, Coimbatore has potential to expand, giving a further push to real estate development here.\n\nFAIRPRO has attracted participation by 25 member developers of CREDAI and more than 50 properties, priced from \u20b920 lakh to \u20b93 crore are up for sale. Banks and HFCs would also have stalls offering various financing options.\n\n(This article was published on December 31, 2014)\n\nRelated"

A fellow at the Penang Institute, he and his colleagues try to answer \"the 1946 question\" of nation-building and multiculturalism: can we be different and equal?\n\nBesides accepting our colonial past and embracing our multi-ethnic future, and delinking affirmative action from Malay-Muslim identity, the third thing we should do is reform our political system so that it can be more competitive, but less volatile.\n\nBig Government for 'nation-building'\n\nBig government is favoured by many Malaysians, not just the leftists who want to control and tamethe market, but even more so by many nationalists, from both the ethnic and civil strands.\n\nExactly because of our diverse population, a strong government is thought to be needed to hold the country together, from the communist threat during Cold War, Indonesia\u2019s territorial ambition under Sukarno, communal conflicts and also separatism of Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nThe Sedition Act represents well the fear that \u201cwe will be in hell if the government is not reigning on us\u201d. The act was expanded after the May 13 riot and is now to be reinforced again to further crack down on criticisms of Islam and Bornean secessionism after the abortive attempt to abolish it.\n\nA powerful government is of course desired by ethno-nationalists and others who believe in assimilation as a tool to shape a national identity by force. For them, Malaysia should have modelled on Suharto\u2019s Indonesia and Thailand to force assimilation on the Chinese and Indian minorities.\n\nThanks to the \u201cnation-building\u201d agenda, our federal system is more centralised than many unitary states.
