Running is an activity that could be maintained while social distancing restrictions were implemented during the pandemic. However, a recent study has indicated that youth runners reported lower running distance, frequency, and intensity during COVID-19. The reason for this reduction and the impact on overall well-being is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the social distancing restrictions during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic influenced running motives, socialization, wellness and mental health in youth long-distance runners.",

That is because running can be performed outside of facilities and with the appropriate social distancing required during COVID-19. However, during spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic, youth long-distance runners reported a decrease in their running habits, including reduced running distance (decreased 14.0%), total number of runs per week (decreased 14.0%), and number of hard runs per week (decreased 27.0%) (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . This is in contrast with adult runners that reportedly increased their running behaviors following social distancing restrictions (DeJong et al., 2021; Holmes et al., 2021; Mosqueira-Ourens et al., 2021) . Adults who made more changes to their running behaviors were injured more but these changes were due to multiple factors (Holmes et al., 2021) . While changes in running habits have been described, motives to run may provide a greater depth of understanding why running habits increased or decreased during COVID-19 social distancing.",

Youth often choose to participate in sports based on social and competition motivational factors (Verkooijen et al., 2009) . Adult and youth long-distance runners have reported that socialization is a strong motive to run (Springer, 2013) . As socialization has been negatively impacted during COVID-19 worldwide (Ammar et al., 2020b) , it is reasonable to assume that socialization has been impacted in runners. This assumption was supported as adult runners who demonstrated a decline in motivation and transition from competition and socialization motives to fitness, occupying time, and stress relief motives (DeJong et al., 2021) . While less has been published in youth runners, competition may also be an important factor related to motivation and enjoyment in children (Chalkley et al., 2020) . As sports seasons and competitions were canceled due to COVID-19, youth runners may have become less motivated to run and felt less enjoyment, potentially contributing to the reported reductions in running (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . Understanding why youth long-distance runners change their running habits provides greater insights that could help coaches and health care professionals prepare youth runners return to running following a period of reduced running.",

            "text": "In addition to reducing physical activity, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to worsening overall wellness across the globe. Sleep problems have been reported as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Voitsidis et al., 2020; Abid et al., 2021; Trabelsi et al., 2021) . During COVID-19 confinement, consumption of more unhealthy foods increased and more snacking occurred (Ammar et al., 2020a; Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020; Sanchez-Sanchez et al., 2020) . Elevated stress and anxiety levels have consistently been reported during COVID-19 social distancing and isolation (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2020b; Papandreou et al., 2020) . These findings of increased stress and anxiety have also been observed in youth athletes; however, most of these athletes participate in sports that cannot be competed in or practiced during social distancing (McGuine et al., 2020 (McGuine et al., , 2021 . Since many runners can continue their physical activity without access to facilities, they may be at a lower risk of worsening mental health during COVID-19 social distancing. Recently, Bazett-Jones et al. (2020) found that youth runners did not maintain physical activity and reported reduced running habits during COVID-19. Therefore, it appears that youth runners may not have benefitted as expected from the potential mental health effects of physical activity during COVID-19. Thus, it is important to understand the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on the mental health and overall wellness of youth runners.",

Participants were included in the study if they were 9-19 years of age and participated in long-distance running activities including team/club cross-country, track and field (distances \u2265800 m), road races, or recreational running. Participants were excluded if their primary sport was not cross-country or track and field and they did not participate in long-distance running activities and/or if they resided outside of the United States. Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Toledo and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Consent was obtained for participants 18 or 19 years of age and parental permission/child assent were obtained for participants 9-17 years old. Parents were encouraged to assist their child when necessary. The participants did not receive incentives for participating.",

The most common reason for exclusion was due to being outside the required age range. In total, 235 (81.9%) and 52 (18.1%) participants reported they were competitive and recreational runners, respectively. Participants resided in 20 different states with most from the Midwest of the United States (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020). Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth longdistance runners reported lower overall motivation to run (p < 0.001) during COVID-19 social distance restrictions ( Table 1) . The motives for running were also significantly changed. Compared to their pre-COVID-19 responses, youth long-distance runners reported increases in the average motive rankings of running to occupy free time (p < 0.001), relieve stress (p < 0.001), and for exercise/fitness benefits (p < 0.001) during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Running for competition (p < 0.001) and socialization (p < 0.001) were reported as having lower average motive rankings during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19. No difference was observed in the motive ranking of running for pleasure (p = 0.71) between pre-and during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Pre-COVID-19, the most commonly reported greatest motive (ranked first) to run was competition (n = 151, 58.1%; Table 2), followed by exercise/fitness benefits (n = 51, 19.6%) and socialization (n = 31, 11.9%). Following COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, the most commonly reported greatest motive (ranked first) to run was exercise/fitness benefits (n = 107, 41.2%) followed by competition (n = 60, 23.1%) and to occupy free time (n = 33, 12.7%). During COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, a greater proportion of youth long-distance runners reported mostly running alone (pre-COVID-19 n = 36, 13.8%; during COVID-19 n = 171, 65.8%; z = 12.1; Table 3 ) and with family (pre-COVID-19 n = 8, 3.1%; during COVID-19 n = 41, 15.8%; z = 5.0) while a lesser proportion reported mostly running with teammates (pre-COVID-19 n = 196, 75.4%; during COVID-19 n = 24, 9.2%; z = \u221215.3). Similar proportions were noted observed for running with coaches (pre-COVID-19 n = 4, 1.5%; during COVID-19 n = 1, 0.4%; z = \u22121.3) and friends (pre-COVID-19 n = 16, 6.2%; post-COVID-19 n = 23, 8.8%; z = 1.2).",

            "text": "Youth long-distance runners' motivation and motives for running were different during COVID-19, likely due to the elimination of competitive seasons or events. Overall, selfreported motivation was significantly less during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (8.8% decrease). The top ranked motive, on average, for youth long distance runners pre-COVID-19 was competition but this motive fell to 5 th highest ranked motivator during COVID-19, which was a significant difference. Most youth runners ranked competition as their number one motivator pre-COVID-19 but this decreased to less than a quarter during COVID-19. Competition motivates youth to run (Chalkley et al., 2020) and removal of this competition motivator likely contributed to the decrease in running seen in this population during the pandemic (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . The only other motivator to decrease in its average ranking was socialization, moving from the 3 rd highest ranked motivator, on average, pre-COVID-19 to the lowest ranked motivator during COVID-19. Cancellation of these competitive seasons also impacted youth long-distance runner socialization in that practice with teammates was no longer possible, which is also a strong motivator in runners (Springer, 2013; Chalkley et al., 2020) . These results are consistent with changes in motivators in adult runners during the pandemic. DeJong et al. (2021) reported decreases in competition and socialization motivators in adult runners during COVID-19 than reported prior to COVID-19. The change in motivators for youth long-distance runners may also have influenced the significant decrease in self-reported enjoyment of running during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions compared to pre-COVID-19. Due to the removal of competition and social interactions of the team, it may be that the youth long-distance runner in our study experienced less enjoyment due to the lack of these extrinsic motivators.",

Pre-COVID-19 restrictions, running took place with other people 86.2% of the time, but this fell to 34.2% during COVID-19. Cancellation of competitive seasons and team practices significantly reduced the opportunity for socialization with teammates. Almost five times as many runners ran alone during COVID-19 (n = 171/248) compared to pre-COVID-19 (n = 31/248) social distancing restrictions. This significant increase in running alone could be related to the lower enjoyment or motivation reported. Collegiate runners have reported greater enjoyment while running with others than alone (Carnes et al., 2015) . Enjoyment during sport participation is an important factor to maintaining involvement and reducing dropout (Gardner et al., 2017) . Maintaining enjoyment in this population during short-or long-term isolation (i.e., COVID-19, injury) is likely important to the youth long-distance runner. Similar isolation may be experienced in runners removed from competition due to injury. Strategies for maintaining socialization and enjoyment should be important topics of future investigations in this population. Parental involvement has been reported to positively influence enjoyment in youth tennis players (Hoyle and Leff, 1997) . While our findings indicated an increase of runners running with their family members, the percentage doing so was fairly low so we are not certain if it may have offset the reduction in enjoyment.",

Interestingly, running as an activity to occupy free time was ranked last pre-COVID-19 (0% ranked as #1) but became the 2 nd highest ranked motivator during COVID-19 (12.7% ranked as #1). In adult runners, an increase in motivation to occupy free time has also been reported (DeJong et al., 2021) . In the same study (DeJong et al., 2021) , however, the adult runners did not show increases in other motivators. While youth long-distance runners reduced their running frequency and distance during COVID-19 (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) , the health benefits (exercise, stress relief) of running stayed as a strong motivator. Running for exercise was ranked #1 by almost 20% of participants' pre-COVID-19 and this increased to over 40% during COVID-19. These findings demonstrate that many youth long-distance runners are motivated to continue running despite the lack of competition and socialization. Further research on subgroups of those who are motivated by different factors should be undertaken to investigate their long-term impact on physical activity once competition is removed due to matriculation.",

The global pandemic of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on mental health. During COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, increased anxiety (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) and decreased overall mental health (Liang et al., 2020) have been reported in the general adolescent and youth populations. Our findings are consistent with these studies (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) in that the youth longdistance runners reported a significant increase in anxiety during COVID-19 compared to their self-reported pre-COVID-19 levels. This elevation in anxiety could be related to a decrease in running in this population (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020) . Abruptly stopping running for as little as 2 weeks has been reported to cause an increase in depressive symptoms in regular runners (Morris et al., 1990) .

            "text": "In our study, youth long-distance runners reported positive and negative changes to their wellness habits. They reported an increase in sleep duration but a higher proportion reported poor sleep quality during COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. Increased sleep duration during COVID-19 confinement has been consistently reported in adolescents (Kaditis et al., 2021; Ramos Socarras et al., 2021) . However, long-distance runners have been reported to have inadequate sleep compared to recommendations (Garcia et al., 2021) . Increase in sleep duration is desirable because increased sleep duration improves attention, behavior, learning, memory, emotional regulation, quality of life, and mental and physical health (Paruthi et al., 2016; Fox et al., 2020) . Symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression are more likely to be reported in adolescent athletes with poor sleep quality (Gomes et al., 2017; Potter et al., 2020) . Unfortunately, we are unable to discern if poor sleep quality is a result of increased anxiety or if increased anxiety is a result of poor sleep quality. It is unknown what long-term implications these changes may have, including how sleep quality and anxiety interact.",

Consumption of unhealthy food, increased snacking, increased overall number of meals, and/or eating out of control may all contribute to a lower quality diet (Ammar et al., 2020a) . This worsening of consumed food quality could be attributed to reduced motivation, eating in response to boredom or anxiety or other mood-driven eating (Di Renzo et al., 2020; Papandreou et al., 2020) . To our knowledge, the nutritional habits of youth longdistance runners has not been reported during COVID-19 and therefore, we are unable to understand the extent and meaningfulness of this reduction in self-reported food quality in our study sample.",

First, the cross-sectional nature of an online survey may have introduced some recall bias which influenced the reporting of some variables of interest. We attempted to minimize the impact of this by limiting the recall period to 6 months prior to COVID-19. Social distancing restrictions also differed in extent and timeline based on state government decisions, likely leading to variability in the stay-at-home orders affecting each participant. Second, our study was also limited in its measurement at one time point. Future research should study these variables in runners during the season following the COVID-19 restrictions to provide evidence of a long-lasting impact on youth longdistance runners. Third, though we attempted to get a broad sense of the COVID-19 impact on the runners, the responses were weighted more heavily among a few US states which may have introduced a geographic bias. Finally, the questions and/or scales used in this study have received limited investigation into their validity and reliability. The questions/scales may be missing or unable to measure important components of various concepts regarding motives, sleep, food quality, and anxiety. Further research is needed on these various topics in adolescents and long-distance runners.",

Youth long-distance runners experienced changes in motivation, lower enjoyment of running, changes in wellness, and more anxiety even though they were not necessarily restricted in their ability to run, only the context and reasons for which they participated. However, running distance and frequency were reduced (Bazett-Jones et al., 2020), which may have been influenced by the removal of competition and social motivators. The use of technology to create competition or increase social interactions during times of increased isolation may be one solution to these barriers that warrants future investigation.",
