Designing small molecule inhibitors targeting SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction is considered as a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2. But to date, only a few compounds have been reported as SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction inhibitors. In this study, we described the virtual screening and experimental validation of two novel inhibitors (DC-RA016 and DC-RA052) against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. The NanoBiT assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays demonstrated their capabilities of blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and directly binding to both S-RBD and ACE2. Moreover, the pseudovirus assay revealed that these two compounds possessed significant antiviral activity (about 50% inhibition rate at maximum non-cytotoxic concentration). These results indicate that the compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 are promising inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and deserve to be further developed.",

In humans, the primary receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) Zhang H. et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recognizes and binds to ACE2 through the receptor-binding domain . Then it is hydrolytically activated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and mediates subsequent virushost cell membrane fusion ( Figure 1A ) (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . The binding affinity between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 has been determined to be low to \u223c15 nM and 10 to 20 fold higher than that reported in SARS-CoV in 2002, which may be an important cause of the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Considering such a critical role of the interaction between spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, the inhibition of such interaction is considered as a particularly attractive strategy for the development of treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infections (Li et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020; Yang J. et al., 2020) .",

Hence, there remains a critical need and challenge to discover safe and effective inhibitors against the interaction between S-RBD and ACE2. In this study, we identified two novel inhibitors (named DC-RA016 and DC-RA052) against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction through structure-based virtual screening and biological experiments. NanoLuc binary technology (NanoBiT)-based binding and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay demonstrated that DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 could bind to both S-RBD and ACE2, blocking the interaction between them. Additionally, the pseudovirus assay and cytotoxicity experiment showed that both DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 have moderate inhibition ability to SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus and low cytotoxicity. In addition, the preliminary pharmacophore analysis and the mechanism action study of DC-RA016 were carried out to further uncover the inhibitory mechanism of the compound on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. Therefore, these two compounds are promising new inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and worth further development.",

Compounds bound to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2. Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2 with compounds measured by SPR. The SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2 was coated on the CM5 sensor chip and serial dilutions of compounds (typically, 1,562.5, 3,125, 6,250, 12,500, 25,000, 50, To analyze the mechanism of action of DC-RA016, the binding pose of the compound DC-RA016 on the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface was generated by XP docking. As shown in Figure 6A , DC-RA016 could form strong interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 complex interface. The two phenolic hydroxyls of DC-RA016 respectively formed H-bonds with the His-34 of ACE2 and Gly496 of S-RBD. The replacement of the R1 group of DC-RA016 with other structures would disrupt such interaction, which provided the structural explanation for the impaired activity of compounds DC-RA016-1 to DC-RA016-8. Additionally, an electrostatic interaction also occurred between the nitro of DC-RA016 and Asp-30 of ACE2, which accounted for the stronger inhibitory activity of compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA016-12 than compounds DC-RA016-9, DC-RA016-10, and DC-RA016-11. Compared with DC-RA016, the change of the position of chlorine substitution in DC-RA016-12 didn't have obvious effects on its inhibitory activity. Moreover, although its R 2 group was quite different from that of DC-RA016, DC-RA016-9 still displayed certain inhibitory activity. These results suggested that the R 2 group was not the essential pharmacophore of DC-RA016, so we plan to carry further structural modification on this group in the future.",

            "text": "The docking analysis on DC-RA052, another important inhibitor, was also carried out. As shown in Figure 6B , Lys-417, Gln-409, Glu-406, Arg-403, Tyr-505 of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, and His-34 of ACE2 were found to form H-bonds with DC-RA052. Moreover, the benzene ring and pyridine ring of DC-RA052 formed \u03c0-cation interaction with the Arg-408 and Arg-403 of S-RBD. Comparing the binding modes of DC-RA016 and DC-RA052, it could be noted that both DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 interacted with the Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2. Then, based on the docked complex structures, we calculated the per-residue interaction scores with glide. The results indicated the strong interaction of Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 to DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 (Supplementary Table S1 ). Moreover, as shown in Figure 6C , there was a deep pocket (marked with the red circle) on the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface. Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 were both at the edge of this pocket. Hence, we considered Arg-403 of S-RBD and His-34 of ACE2 as two key residues responsible for the binding of ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ ACE2 interface. To explore the reason why the binding of identified inhibitors can influence SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction, the mean effects of mutation of each residue within 5 \u00c5 of DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 were visualized. The data for visualization was obtained from a previous study, where Starr et al. systematically changed every amino acid in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and determined the effects of the substitutions on ACE2 binding. The mean effects per site were calculated from the set of \u0394log 10 (K D , app) measurements of all missense mutations at a site (Starr et al., 2020) . \u0394log 10 (K D , app) represents the log binding constants relative to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 , the mutations of many residues around DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 such as Ile-418 and Phe-497 could significantly reduce the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2, which mean these residues played key roles in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. And yet, binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface, DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 would contact with these residues and interfere with their functions, disrupting the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2.",

In this study, the structural-based virtual screening was conducted to search for the compounds that can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction. The screened compounds were docked by targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interface. Subsequently, A NanoBiT-based binding assay was performed to evaluate the inhibition effect of those compounds on SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction resulting in 24 potential inhibitor candidates. Among them, DC-RA016, DC-RA052, and DC-RA087 displayed low cytotoxicity and moderate inhibition ability to SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirus. Furthermore, the SPR assays identified that DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 could directly bond to both ACE2 and S-RBD. Taken together, the compounds DC-RA016 and DC-RA052 obtained in this study can serve as an ideal starting point for drug design against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 interaction and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, two biological active analogues of DC-RA016 were discovered through the 2D similarity search. Among them, DC-RA016-12 exhibited similar activity to DC-RA016 in NanoBiT-based assay.",
