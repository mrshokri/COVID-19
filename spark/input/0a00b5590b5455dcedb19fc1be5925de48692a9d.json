The decrease followed national awareness campaigns, changes in prescribing guidelines, and National Health Service (NHS) quality improvement and assurance schemes, all aimed at reducing prescribing in both primary and secondary care [3] [4] [5] [6] . Changes in antibacterial prescribing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic were anticipated given that clinical features of the severe respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those caused by bacteria. Moreover, markers of infection such as C-reactive protein did not effectively distinguish between bacterial and viral pneumonia infections. Such diagnostic challenges complicated the decision for clinicians as to whether to prescribe antibiotics empirically [7] .",

Other studies have also shown high levels of empirical antibiotic treatment for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic [15, 16] .

The rise in use of 'Watch' category antibacterials was mainly due to the increased use of co-amoxiclav, third-generation cephalosporins (specifically ceftriaxone), and macrolides ( Figure S9 and S10). The rise in macrolide usage was mainly driven by clarithromycin, with small increases seen in azithromycin and erythromycin ( Figure S10 ). The rate of piperacillin/tazobactam use within the 'Watch' category increased by 82.8% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. This baseline level is historically low following a global shortage in 2017 ( Figure S11 ). The rise in the percentage of 'Reserve' category antibiotics by 0.2 percentage points in April 2020 in comparison to April 2019 was predominantly due to a 79.5% increase in the use of carbapenems ( Figure S12 ).",

Nonetheless, a small rise in the number of broad-spectrum antibacterial items was seen in April 2020 compared to April 2019, particularly in older adults over the age of 75, driven by co-amoxiclav prescribing in this age group. The co-amoxiclav increase seen in older patients was also observed in North West London [29] . This may reflect treatment of other primary infections, such as urinary tract infections, to avoid hospital admission during the pandemic, further work is required to evidence whether the antibacterial use was appropriate. The use of certain broad-spectrum antibacterials, particularly cephalosporins and quinolones, is associated with increased risks of CDI and should be reserved for treating resistant infections [22] . Although the count of CDI in April to June 2020 decreased compared to the same period in the previous year, reported community-onset, community-associated CDI increased slightly [30] . Further investigations are needed to understand the large reduction of antibacterial use in the community and its impacts on infections.",

This was also seen in Scotland [17] and is thought to be due to additional prescribing of 'just in case' rescue antibiotic packs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients at risk of severe respiratory disease. Oral amoxicillin and oral doxycycline were recommended as first-choice treatments in the pre-COVID NICE community-acquired pneumonia guideline [31] , and the usage of both antibacterials increased in March 2020 compared to March 2019. Both antibiotics were commonly prescribed within 14 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in North West London [29] . While amoxicillin use saw a sharp decrease from March to May 2020, doxycycline use increased slightly in April 2020 compared to April 2019 when the COVID-19 rapid guideline was published, as doxycycline was recommended over amoxicillin due to the broader spectrum of cover against secondary bacterial causes of pneumonia [19] .",

However, the rate of prescribing measured in DDDs/1000 admissions increased sharply in April 2020, only returning in July 2020 to similar levels seen in previous years. This is likely to be due to hospitals implementing rapid changes in healthcare service provision such as cancellation of elective admissions and staff redeployment in March 2020 to adapt hospital capacity to COVID-19 treatment demands [36] . Hence, although hospital activity was greatly diminished during the first wave of the pandemic, patients who were admitted to hospital were likely to be more acutely and seriously ill and their clinical treatment potentially more driven by 'therapeutic aggressiveness' in situations with sometimes scarce evidence [37] .",

Another study has also shown that broad-spectrum antibiotic use in hospitals was common [38] , despite insufficient evidence of a high percentage of hospitalised COVID-19 patients with bacterial co-infection [10, 11] . Third-generation cephalosporins, part of the 'Watch' category, doubled in use in April 2020 compared to April 2019; with specific increases seen in ceftriaxone. This is thought to be due to Trusts selecting the once daily ceftriaxone to save nursing time. However, the percentage of 'Watch' use we present is lower than shown in other studies [11] . Conversely, despite the 'Access' category containing antibacterials that are recommended as first-line treatments for CAP and HAP, the percentage of their use was lower during the first wave of the pandemic. This may be due to approximately 40% of hospitals in the UK reporting that they were already aligned with the published national guidelines, while 12% stated they did not plan to update their local guidelines [20] .",

Our data showed that azithromycin usage in hospital in April 2020 has increased but only slightly, despite considerable media attention given to the potential therapeutic role of azithromycin. This is encouraging and suggests it was not widely used outside trial settings.

Moreover, since healthcare provision and healthcare-seeking behaviour changed significantly during the first months of the pandemic, additional information on primary care consultations are needed to interpret and adjust for changes in prescribing rates. The role of inflammatory markers needs to be investigated in research such as the National Institute for Health Research funded PEACH trial for procalcitonin [43] , as there is currently limited evidence for their routine use but they have been indicated by hospitals to guide decisions for antibacterial treatments [7] .

This is a quasi-experimental design that can be used to assess whether changes from the population-level interventions are greater than the underlying trend before the intervention [46] . The 'first-wave' of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England was defined for the purpose of this study as January 2020 to October 2020 (the 'intervention'). The pre-pandemic period was defined from January 2015 (April 2015 for primary care age group analysis) to December 2019. The dummy intervention variable was set to 0 pre-COVID and 1 post-COVID.",

Seasonality was adjusted for (in calendar months) as an independent variable in the model, resulting in incidence-rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals [48] . The percentages of specific antibacterials to total prescriptions before and after COVID-19 were compared using linear regression. The regression models were used to predict antibacterial consumption during COVID-19 that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic using the underlying trend (the counterfactual scenario). For the equations and results of the regression models, see Tables S4 and S5. Stata 15 was used in all data analyses [49] .",
